<h2>Rule 106. Delivery of military offenders to civilian authorities</h2>
<p>Under such regulations as the Secretary concerned may prescribe, a member of the armed forces accused of an offense against civilian authority may be delivered, upon request, to the civilian authority for trial. A member may be placed in restraint by military authorities for this purpose only upon receipt of a duly issued warrant for the apprehension of the member or upon receipt of information establishing probable cause that the member committed an offense, and upon reasonable belief that such restraint is necessary. Such restraint may continue only for such time as is reasonably necessary to effect the delivery.</p>

<h3>(a) In general.</h3>
<p>Each Judge Advocate General is responsible for the professional supervision and discipline of military trial and appellate military judges, judge advocates, and other lawyers who practice in proceedings governed by the code and this Manual. To discharge this responsibility each Judge Advocate General may prescribe rules of professional conduct not inconsistent with this rule or this Manual. Rules of professional conduct promulgated pursuant to this rule may include sanctions for violations of such rules. Sanctions may include but are not limited to indefinite suspension from practice in courts-martial and in the Courts of Criminal Appeals. Such suspensions may only be imposed by the Judge Advocate General of the armed service of such courts. Prior to imposing any discipline under this rule, the subject of the proposed action must be provided notice and an opportunity to be heard. The Judge Advocate General concerned may upon good cause shown modify or revoke suspension.

In cases where a person is tried by general court-martial for offenses against the law of an occupied territory, the court-martial normally sits in the country where the offense is committed, and must do so under certain circumstances. <em>See</em> Articles 4, 64, and 66, Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, August 12, 1949, arts. 4, 64, and 66, 6 U.S.T. 3516, 3559-60 T.I.A.S.

</ol>
<section class="level5" id="discussion-23">
<h5>Discussion</h5>
<p>In the case of an act or omission which violates the code and a criminal law of a State, the United States, or both, the determination which agency shall exercise jurisdiction should normally be made through consultation or prior agreement between appropriate military officials (ordinarily the staff judge advocate) and appropriate civilian authorities (United States Attorney, or equivalent). <em>See also</em> Memorandum of Understanding Between Departments of Justice and Defense Relating to the Investigation and Prosecution of Crimes Over Which the Two Departments Have Concurrent Jurisdiction at Appendix 3. Under the Constitution, a person may not be tried for the same misconduct by both a court-martial and another federal court. _ See_ R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(C). Although it is constitutionally permissible to try a person by court-martial and by a State court for the same act, as a matter of policy a person who is pending trial or has been tried by a State court should not ordinarily be tried by court-martial for the same act. Overseas, international agreements might preclude trial by one state of a person acquitted or finally convicted of a given act by the other state. Under international law, a friendly foreign nation has jurisdiction to punish offenses committed within its borders by members of a visiting force, unless expressly or impliedly consents to relinquish its jurisdiction to the visiting sovereign. The procedures and standards for determining which nation will exercise jurisdiction are normally established by treaty. <em>See</em>, for example, NATO Status of Forces Agreement, June 19, 1951, 4 U.S.T. 1792, T.I.A.S. No. 2846. As a matter of policy, efforts should be made to maximize the exercise of court-martial jurisdiction over persons subject to the code to the extent possible under applicable agreements. <em> See</em> R.C.M. 106 concerning delivery of offenders to civilian authorities. <em> See</em> also R.C.M. 201(g) concerning the jurisdiction of other military tribunals.</p>

<h5>(1) Authority under the code.</h5>
<p>Article 2 lists classes of persons who are subject to the code. These include active duty personnel (Article 2(a)(1)); cadets, aviation cadets, and midshipmen (Article 2(a)(2)); certain retired personnel (Article 2(a)(4) and (5)); members of Reserve components not on active duty under some circumstances</p>

A person need not be subject to the code to be subject to trial by court-martial under Articles 83, 104, or 106. <em>See also</em> Article 48 and R.C.M. 809 concerning who may be subject to the contempt powers of a court-martial.</p>
</section>
<section class="level5" id="active-duty-personnel.">
<h5>(2) Active duty personnel.</h5>
<p>Court-martial jurisdiction is most commonly exercised over active duty personnel. In general, a person becomes subject to court-martial jurisdiction upon enlistment in or induction into the armed forces, acceptance of a commission, or entry onto active duty pursuant to orders. Court-martial jurisdiction over active duty personnel ordinarily ends on delivery of a discharge certificate or its equivalent to the person concerned issued pursuant to competent orders. Orders transferring a person to the inactive reserve are the equivalent of a discharge certificate for purposes of jurisdiction. These are several important qualifications and exceptions to these general guidelines.</p>
<section class="level6" id="a-inception-of-court-martial-jurisdiction-over-active-duty-personnel.">
<h6>(A) Inception of court-martial jurisdiction over active duty personnel.</h6>
<section class="level7" id="i-enlistment.">
<p>(i) Enlistment.</p>
<p>"The voluntary enlistment of any person who has the capacity to understand the significance of enlisting in the armed forces shall be valid for purposes of jurisdiction under [Article 2(a)] and a change of status from civilian to member of the armed forces shall be effective upon taking the oath of enlistment." Article 2(b). A person who is, at the time of enlistment, insane, intoxicated, or under the age of 17 does not have the capacity to enlist by law. No court-martial jurisdiction over such a person may exist as long as the incapacity continues. If the incapacity ceases to exist, a "constructive enlistment" may result under Article 2(c). <em>See</em> discussion of "constructive enlistment" below. Similarly, if the enlistment was involuntary, court-martial jurisdiction will exist only when the coercion is removed and a "constructive enlistment" under Article 2(c) is established. Persons age 17 (but not yet 18) may not enlist without parental consent. A parent or guardian may, within 90 days of its inception, terminate the enlistment of a 17-year-old who enlisted without parental consent, if the person has not yet reached the age of 18. 10 U.S.C. § 1170. <em>See also</em> DOD Directive 1332.14 and service regulations for specific rules on separation of persons 17 years of age on the basis of a parental request. Absent effective action by a parent or guardian to terminate such an enlistment, court-martial jurisdiction exists over the person. An application by a parent for release does not deprive a court-martial of jurisdiction to try a person for offenses committed before action is completed on such an application. Even if a person lacked capacity to understand the effect of enlistment or did not enlist voluntarily, a "constructive enlistment" may be established under Article 2(c), which provides: Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person serving with an armed force who- submitted voluntary to military authority; met the mental competency and minimum age qualifications of sections 504 and 505 of this title at the time of voluntary submission to military authority [that is, not insane, intoxicated, or under the age of 17] received military pay or allowances; and performed military duties;</p>
<p>is subject to [the code] until such person's active service has been terminated in accordance with law or regulations promulgated by the Secretary concerned. Even if a person never underwent an enlistment or induction proceeding of any kind, court-martial jurisdiction could be established under this provision.</p>
</section>
<section class="level7" id="ii-induction.">
<p>(ii) Induction.</p>
<p>Court-martial jurisdiction does not extend to a draftee until: the draftee has completed an induction ceremony which was in substantial compliance with the requirements prescribed by statute and regulations; the draftee by conduct after an apparent induction, has waived objection to substantive defects in it; or a "constructive enlistment" under Article 2(c) exists. The fact that a person was improperly inducted (for example, because of incorrect classification or erroneous denial of exemption) does not of itself negate court-martial jurisdiction. When a person has made timely and persistent efforts to correct such an error, court-martial jurisdiction may be defeated if improper induction is found, depending on all the circumstances of the case.</p>
</section>
<section class="level7" id="iii-call-to-active-duty.">
<p>(iii) Call to active duty.</p>
<p>A member of a reserve component may be called or ordered to active duty for a variety of reasons, including training, service in time of war or national emergency, discipline, or as a result of failure to participate satisfactorily in unit activities. When a person is ordered to active duty for failure to satisfactorily participate in unit activities, the order must substantially comply with procedures prescribed by regulations, to the extent due process requires, for court-martial jurisdiction to exist. Generally, the person must be given notice of the activation and the reasons therefor, and an opportunity to object to the activation. A person waives the right to contest involuntary activation by failure to exercise this right within a reasonable time after notice of the right to do so.</p>

<h6>(B) Termination of jurisdiction over active duty personnel.</h6>
<p>As indicated above, the delivery of a valid discharge certificate or its equivalent ordinarily serves to terminate court-martial jurisdiction.</p>
<section class="level7" id="i-effect-of-completion-of-term-of-service.">
<p>(i) Effect of completion of term of service.</p>
<p>Completion of an enlistment or term of service does not by itself terminate court-martial jurisdiction. An original term of enlistment may be adjusted for a variety of reasons, such as making up time lost for unauthorized absence. Even after such adjustments are considered, court-martial jurisdiction normally continues past the time of scheduled separation until a discharge certificate or its equivalent is delivered or until the Government fails to act within a reasonable time after the person objects to continued retention. As indicated in subsection (c) of this rule, servicemembers may be retained past their scheduled time of separation, over protest, by action with a view to trial while they are still subject to the code. Thus, if action with a view to trial is initiated before discharge or the effective terminal date of self-executing orders, a person may be retained beyond the date that the period of service would otherwise have expired or the terminal date of such orders.</p>

For offenses occurring prior to 23 October 1992, a person who reenlists following a discharge may be tried for offenses committed during the earlier term of service only if the offense was punishable by confinement for five (5) years or more and could not be tried in the courts of the United States or of a State, a Territory, or the District of Columbia.

<li><p>The person is, at the time of the court-martial, subject to the code, by reentry into the armed forces or otherwise. <em>See</em> Article 3(a) prior to the 1992 amendment.</p></li>

<li><p>The person remains, at the time of the court-martial, subject to the code; and</p></li>

<li><p>Persons in the custody of the armed forces serving a sentence imposed by a court-martial remain subject to the code and court-martial jurisdiction. A prisoner who has received a discharge and who remains in the custody of an armed force may be tried for an offense committed while a member of the armed forces and before the execution of the discharge as well as for offenses committed after it.</p></li>
<li><p>A person discharged from the armed forces who is later charged with having fraudulently obtained that discharge is, subject to the statute of limitations, subject to trial by court-martial on that charge, and is after apprehension subject to the code while in the custody of the armed forces for trial. Upon conviction of that charge such a person is subject to trial by court-martial for any offenses under the code committed before the fraudulent discharge.</p></li>
<li><p>No person who has deserted from the armed forces is relieved from court-martial jurisdiction by a separation from any later period of service.</p></li>
<li><p>When a person's discharge or other separation does not interrupt the status as a person belonging to the general category of persons subject to the code, court-martial jurisdiction over that person does not end. For example, when an officer holding a commission in a Reserve component of an armed force is discharged from that commission while on active duty because of acceptance of a commission in a Regular component of that armed force, without an interval between the periods of service under the two commissions, that officer's military status does not end. There is merely a change in personnel status from temporary to permanent officer, and court-martial jurisdiction over an offense committed before the discharge is not affected.</p></li>

<h5>Discussion</h5>
<p>Apprehension is the equivalent of "arrest" in civilian terminology. (In military terminology, "arrest" is a form of restraint. _ See_ Article 9; R.C.M. 304.) <em>See</em> subsection</p>
<ol type="a" start="3">
<li>of this rule concerning the bases for apprehension. An apprehension is not required in every case; the fact that an accused was never apprehended does not affect the jurisdiction of a court-martial to try the accused. However, <em> see</em> R.C.M. 202(c) concerning attachment of jurisdiction. An apprehension is different from detention of a person for investigative purposes, although each involves the exercise of government control over the freedom of movement of a person. An apprehension must be based on probable cause, and the custody initiated in an apprehension may continue until proper authority is notified and acts under R.C.M. 304 or 305. An investigative detention may be made on less than probable cause (<em>see</em> Mil. R. Evid. 314(f)), and normally involves a relatively short period of custody. Furthermore, an extensive search of the person is not authorized incident to an investigative detention, as it is with an apprehension. <em>See</em> Mil. R. Evid. 314(f) and (g). This rule does not affect any seizure of the person less severe than apprehension. Evidence obtained as the result of an apprehension which is in violation of this rule may be challenged under Mil. R. Evid. 311(c)(1). Evidence obtained as the result of an unlawful civilian arrest may be challenged under Mil. R. Evid. 311(c)(1), (2).</li>

<h5>Discussion</h5>
<p>R.C.M. 302 does not affect the authority of any official to detain, arrest, or apprehend persons not subject to trial under the code. The rule does not apply to actions taken by any person in a private capacity. Several federal agencies have broad powers to apprehend persons for violations of federal laws, including the Uniform Code of Military Justice. For example, agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, United States Marshals, and agents of the Secret Service may apprehend persons for any offenses committed in their presence and for felonies. 18 U.S.C. §§ 3052, 3053, 3056. Other agencies have apprehension powers include the General Services Administration, 40 U.S.C. § 318 and the Veterans Administration, 38 U.S.C. § 218. The extent to which such agencies become involved in the apprehension of persons subject to trial by courts-martial may depend on the statutory authority of the agency and the agency's formal or informal relationships with the Department of Defense.</p>

<h2>Rule 303. Preliminary inquiry into reported offenses</h2>
<p>Upon receipt of information that a member of the command is accused or suspected of committing an offense or offenses triable by court-martial, the immediate commander shall make or cause to be made a preliminary inquiry into the charges or suspected offenses.</p>
<section class="level3" id="discussion-47">
<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>The preliminary inquiry is usually informal. It may be an examination of the charges and an investigative report or other summary of expected evidence. In other cases a more extensive investigation may be necessary. Although the commander may conduct the investigation personally or with members of the command, in serious or complex cases the commander should consider whether to seek the assistance of law enforcement personnel in conducting any inquiry or further investigation. The inquiry should gather all reasonably available evidence bearing on guilt or innocence and any evidence relating to aggravation, extenuation, or mitigation. The Military Rules of Evidence should be consulted when conducting interrogations (<em>see</em> Mil. R. Evid. 301-306), searches (<em>see</em> Mil. R. Evid. 311-317), and eyewitness identifications (<em>see</em> Mil. R. Evid. 321). If the offense is one for which the Department of Justice has investigative responsibilities, appropriate coordination should be made under the Memorandum of Understanding,<em> see</em> Appendix 3, and any implementing regulations. If it appears that any witness may not be available for later proceedings in the case, this should be brought to the attention of appropriate authorities. <em> See also</em> R.C.M. 702 (depositions). A person who is an accuser (<em>see</em> Article 1(9)) is disqualified from convening a general or special court-martial in that case. R.C.M. 504(c)(1). Therefore, when the immediate commander is a general or special court-martial convening authority, the preliminary inquiry should be conducted by another officer of the command. That officer may be informed that charges may be preferred if the officer determines that preferral is warranted.</p>

<h2>Rule 304. Pretrial restraint</h2>
<section class="level3" id="a-types-of-pretrial-restraint.">
<h3>(a) Types of pretrial restraint.</h3>
<p>Pretrial restraint is moral or physical restraint on a person's liberty which is imposed before and during disposition of offenses. Pretrial restraint may consist of conditions on liberty, restriction in lieu of arrest, arrest, or confinement.</p>
<section class="level4" id="conditions-on-liberty.">
<h4>(1) Conditions on liberty.</h4>
<p>Conditions on liberty are imposed by orders directing a person to do or refrain from doing specified acts. Such conditions may be imposed in conjunction with other forms of restraint or separately.</p>
</section>
<section class="level4" id="restriction-in-lieu-of-arrest.">
<h4>(2) Restriction in lieu of arrest.</h4>
<p>Restriction in lieu of arrest is the restraint of a person by oral or written orders directing the person to remain within specified limits; a restricted person shall, unless otherwise directed, perform full military duties while restricted.</p>
</section>
<section class="level4" id="arrest.">
<h4>(3) Arrest.</h4>
<p>Arrest is the restraint of a person by oral or written order not imposed as punishment, directing the person to remain within specified limits; a person in the status of arrest may not be required to perform full military duties such as commanding or supervising personnel, serving as guard, or bearing arms. The status of arrest automatically ends when the person is placed, by the authority who ordered the arrest or a superior authority, on duty inconsistent with the status of arrest, but this shall not prevent requiring the person arrested to do ordinary cleaning or policing, or to take part in routine training and duties.</p>
</section>
<section class="level4" id="confinement.">
<h4>(4) Confinement.</h4>
<p>Pretrial confinement is physical restraint, imposed by order of competent authority, depriving a person of freedom pending disposition of offenses. <em>See</em> R.C.M. 305.</p>
<section class="level5" id="discussion-48">
<h5>Discussion</h5>
<p>Conditions on liberty include orders to report periodically to a specified official, orders not to go to a certain place (such as the scene of the alleged offense), and orders not to associate with specified persons</p>
<p>(such as the alleged victim or potential witnesses). Conditions on liberty must not hinder pretrial preparation, however. Thus, when such conditions are imposed, they must by sufficiently flexible to permit pretrial preparation. Restriction in lieu of arrest is a less severe restraint on liberty than is arrest. Arrest includes suspension from performing full military duties and the limits of arrest are normally narrower than those of restriction in lieu of arrest. The actual nature of the restraint imposed, and not the characterization of it by the officer imposing it, will determine whether it is technically an arrest or restriction in lieu of arrest. Breach of arrest or restriction in lieu of arrest or violation of conditions on liberty are offenses under the code. <em>See</em> paragraphs 16, 19, and 102, Part IV. When such an offense occurs, it may warrant appropriate action such as nonjudicial punishment or court-martial. <em>See</em> R.C.M. 306. In addition, such a breach or violation may provide a basis for the imposition of a more severe form of restraint. R.C.M. 707(a) requires that the accused be brought to trial within 120 days of preferral of charges or imposition of restraint under R.C.M. 304(a)(2)-(4).</p>

<p>The person who directs confinement should consider the matters discussed under subsection (h)(2)(B) of this rule before ordering confinement. However, the person who initially orders confinement is not required to make a detailed analysis of the necessity for confinement. It is often not possible to review a person's background and character or even the details of an offense before physically detaining the person. For example, until additional information can be secured, it may be necessary to confine a person apprehended in the course of a violent crime. "[W]hen charged only with an offense normally tried by summary court-martial, [an accused] shall not ordinarily be paced in confinement." Article 10. Confinement should be distinguished from custody. Custody is restraint which is imposed by apprehension and which may be, but is not necessarily, physical. Custody may be imposed by anyone authorized to apprehend</p>
<p>(<em>see</em> R.C.M. 302(b)), and may continue until a proper authority under R.C.M. 304(B) is notified and takes action.

A commander may examine the prisoner's personnel records, police records, and may consider the recommendations of others. Less serious forms of restraint must always be considered before pretrial confinement may be approved. Thus the commander should consider whether the prisoner could be safely returned to the prisoner's unit, at liberty or under restriction, arrest, or conditions on liberty. <em>See</em> R.C.M. 304.</p>

<h2>Rule 306. Initial disposition</h2>
<section class="level3" id="a-who-may-dispose-of-offenses.">
<h3>(a) Who may dispose of offenses.</h3>
<p>Each commander has discretion to dispose of offenses by members of that command. Ordinarily the immediate commander of a person accused or suspected of committing an offense triable by court-martial initially determines how to dispose of that offense. A superior commander may withhold the authority to dispose of offenses in individual cases, types of cases, or generally. A superior commander may not limit the discretion of a subordinate commander to act on cases over which authority has not been withheld.</p>
<section class="level4" id="discussion-66">
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>Each commander in the chain of command has independent, yet overlapping discretion to dispose of offenses within the limits of that officer's authority. Normally, in keeping with the policy in subsection (b) of this rule, the initial disposition decision is made by the official at the lowest echelon with the power to make it. A decision by a commander ordinarily does not bar a different disposition by a superior authority. <em>See</em> R.C.M. 401(c); 601(f). Once charges are referred to a court-martial by a convening authority competent to do so, they may be withdrawn from that court-martial only in accordance with R.C.M. 604. <em>See</em> Appendix 3 with respect to offenses for which coordination with the Department of Justice is required.</p>

<p>Allegations of offenses should be disposed of in a timely manner at the lowest appropriate level of disposition listed in subsection (c) of this rule.</p>
<section class="level4" id="discussion-67">
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>The disposition decision is one of the most important and difficult decisions facing a commander. Many factors must be taken into consideration and balanced, including, to the extent practicable, the nature of the offenses, any mitigating or extenuating circumstances, the views of the victim as to disposition, any recommendations made by subordinate commanders, the interest of justice, military exigencies, and the effect of the decision on the accused and the command. The goal should be a disposition that is warranted, appropriate, and fair. In deciding how an offense should be disposed of, factors the commander should consider, to the extent they are known, include: (A) the nature of and circumstances surrounding the offense and the extent of the harm caused by the offense, including the offense's effect on morale, health, safety, welfare, and discipline; (B) when applicable, the views of the victim as to disposition; (C) existence of jurisdiction over the accused and the offense; (D) availability and admissibility of evidence; (E) the willingness of the victim or others to testify; (F) cooperation of the accused in the apprehension or prosecution of another accused; (G) possible improper motives or biases of the person(s) making the allegation(s); (H) availability and likelihood of prosecution of the same or similar and related charges against the accused by another jurisdiction; (I) appropriateness of the authorized punishment to the particular accused or offense.</p>

<section class="level4" id="discussion-68">
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>Prompt disposition of charges is essential. <em>See</em> R.C.M. 707 (speedy trial requirements). Before determining an appropriate disposition, a commander should ensure that a preliminary inquiry under R.C.M. 303 has been conducted. If charges have not already been preferred, the commander may, if appropriate, prefer them and dispose of them under this rule. <em> But see</em> R.C.M. 601 (c) regarding disqualification of an accuser. If charges have been preferred, the commander should ensure that the accused has been notified in accordance with R.C.M. 308, and that charges are in proper form. _ See_ R.C.M. 307. Each commander who forwards or disposes of charges may make minor changes therein. <em>See</em> R.C.M. 603(a) and (b). If major changes are necessary, the affected charge should be preferred anew. <em>See</em> R.C.M. 603(d). When charges are brought against two or more accused with a view to a joint or common trial, <em> see</em> R.C.M. 307(c)(5); 601(e)(3).

A person who has been the accuser or nominal accuser (<em>see</em> Article 1(9)) may not also serve as the convening authority of a general or special court-martial to which the charges are later referred. <em>See</em> Articles 22(b) and 23(b); R.C.M. 601; however, <em>see</em> R.C.M. 1302(b) (summary court-martial convening authority is not disqualified by being the accuser). A person authorized to dispose of offenses (<em>see</em> R.C.M. 306(a); 401-404 and 407) should not be ordered to prefer charges when this would disqualify that person from exercising that person's authority or would improperly restrict that person's discretion to act on the case. <em>See</em> R.C.M. 104 and 504(c). Charges may be preferred against a person subject to trial by court-martial at any time but should be preferred without unnecessary delay. <em>See</em> the statute of limitations prescribed by Article 43. Preferral of charges should not be unnecessarily delayed. When a good reason exists-as when a person is permitted to continue a course of conduct so that a ringleader or other conspirators may also be discovered or when a suspected counterfeiter goes uncharged until guilty knowledge becomes apparent-a reasonable delay is permissible.

<h4>(4) Multiple offenses.</h4>
<p>Charges and specifications alleging all known offenses by an accused may be preferred at the same time. Each specification shall state only one offense. What is substantially one transaction should not be made the basis for an unreasonable multiplication of charges against one person. Unreasonable multiplication of charges is addressed in R.C.M. 906(b)(12); multiplicity is addressed in R.C.M. 907(b)(3)(B); and punishment limitations are addressed in R.C.M. 1003(c)(1)(C).</p>
<section class="level5" id="discussion-78">
<h5>Discussion</h5>
<p>The prohibition against unreasonable multiplication of charges addresses those features of military law that increase the potential for overreaching in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. It is based on reasonableness, and has no foundation in Constitutional rights. To determine if charges are unreasonably multiplied, see R.C.M. 906(b)(12). Because prosecutors are free to plead in the alternative, it may be reasonable to charge two or more offenses that arise from one transaction if sufficient doubt exists as to the facts or the law. In no case should both an offense and a lesser included offense thereof be separately charged. See also Part IV, paragraph 3, and R.C.M. 601(e)(2) concerning referral of several offenses. <em>See</em> R.C.M. 906(b)(12) and 1003(c)(1)(C). For example, a person should not be charged with both failure to report for a routine scheduled duty, such as reveille, and with absence without leave if the failure to report occurred during the period for which the accused is charged with absence without leave. There are times, however, when sufficient doubt as to the facts or the law exists to warrant making one transaction the basis for charging two or more offenses. In no case should both an offense and a lesser included offense thereof be separately charged. <em>See also </em> R.C.M. 601(e)(2) concerning referral of several offenses.</p>

<h5>Discussion</h5>
<p><em>See also</em> R.C.M. 601(e)(3) concerning joinder of accused. A joint offense is one committed by two or more persons acting together with a common intent. Principals may be charged jointly with the commission of the same offense, but an accessory after the fact cannot be charged jointly with the principal whom the accused is alleged to have received, comforted, or assisted. Offenders are properly joined only if there is a common unlawful design or purpose; the mere fact that several persons happen to have committed the same kinds of offenses at the time, although material as tending to show concert of purpose, does not necessarily establish this. The fact that several persons happen to have absented themselves without leave at about the same time will not, in the absence of evidence indicating a joint design, purpose, or plan justify joining them in one specification, for they may merely have been availing themselves of the same opportunity. In joint offenses the participants may be separately or jointly charged. However, if the participants are members of different armed forces, they must be charged separately because their trials must be separately reviewed. The preparation of joint charges is discussed in subsection (c)(3) Discussion</p>

<li>(viii)<em>(a)</em> of this rule. The advantage of a joint charge is that all accused will be tried at one trial, thereby saving time, labor, and expense.

If the power to convene courts-martial and to administer nonjudicial punishment has been withheld, a commander may not dispose of charges under this rule. Ordinarily charges should be forwarded to the accused's immediate commander for initial consideration as to disposition. Each commander has independent discretion to determine how charges will be disposed of, except to the extent that the commander's authority has been withheld by superior competent authority. <em> See also</em> R.C.M. 104.

As to the rules concerning speedy trial, <em>see</em> R.C.M. 707. <em> See also</em> Articles 10; 30; 33; 98. Before determining an appropriate disposition, a commander who receives charges should ensure that: (1) a preliminary inquiry under R.C.M. 303 has been conducted; (2) the accused has been notified in accordance with R.C.M. 308; and (3) the charges are in proper form.</p>

<h5>Discussion</h5>
<p>Charges are ordinarily dismissed by lining out and initialing the deleted specifications or otherwise recording that a specification is dismissed. When all charges and specifications are dismissed, the accuser and the accused ordinarily should be informed. A charge should be dismissed when it fails to state an offense, when it is unsupported by available evidence, or when there are other sound reasons why trial by court-martial is not appropriate. Before dismissing charges because trial would be detrimental to the prosecution of a war or harmful to national security, <em>see</em> R.C.M. 401(d); 407(b). If the accused has already refused nonjudicial punishment, charges should not be dismissed with a view to offering nonjudicial punishment unless the accused has indicated willingness to accept nonjudicial punishment if again offered. The decision whether to dismiss charges in such circumstances is within the sole discretion of the commander concerned. Charges may be amended in accordance with R.C.M. 603. It is appropriate to dismiss a charge and prefer another charge anew when, for example, the original charge failed to state an offense, or was so defective that a major amendment was required (<em>see</em> R.C.M. 603(d)), or did not adequately reflect the nature or seriousness of the offense. <em> See</em> R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(C) concerning the effect of dismissing charges after the court-martial has begun.</p>

<h6>Discussion</h6>
<p>A commander's recommendation is within that commander's sole discretion. No authority may direct a commander to make a specific recommendation as to disposition. When charges are forwarded to a superior commander with a view to trial by general or special court-martial, they should be forwarded by a letter of transmittal or indorsement. To the extent practicable without unduly delaying forwarding the charges, the letter should include or carry as enclosures: a summary of the available evidence relating to each offense; evidence of previous convictions and nonjudicial punishments of the accused; an indication that the accused has been offered and refused nonjudicial punishment, if applicable; and any other matters required by superior authority or deemed appropriate by the forwarding commander. Other matters which may be appropriate include information concerning the accused's background and character of military service, and a description of any unusual circumstances in the case. The summary of evidence should include available witness statements, documentary evidence, and exhibits. When practicable, copies of signed statements of the witnesses should be forwarded, as should copies of any investigative or laboratory reports. Forwarding charges should not be delayed, however, solely to obtain such statements or reports when it otherwise appears that sufficient evidence to warrant trial is or will be available in time for trial. If because of the bulk of documents or exhibits, it is impracticable to forward them with the letter of transmittal, they should be properly preserved and should be referred to in the letter of transmittal. When it appears that any witness may not be available for later proceedings in the case or that a deposition may be appropriate, that matter should be brought to the attention of the convening authority promptly and should be noted in the letter of transmittal. When charges are forwarded with a view to disposition other than trial by general or special court-martial, they should be accompanied by sufficient information to enable the authority receiving them to dispose of them without further investigation.</p>

<h3>(a) In general.</h3>
<p>Except as provided in subsection (k) of this rule, no charge or specification may be referred to a general court-martial for trial until completion of a preliminary hearing in substantial compliance with this rule. A preliminary hearing conducted under this rule is not intended to serve as a means of discovery and will be limited to an examination of those issues necessary to determine whether there is probable cause to conclude that an offense or offenses have been committed and whether the accused committed it; to determine whether a court-martial would have jurisdiction over the offense(s) and the accused; to consider the form of the charge(s); and to recommend the disposition that should be made of the charge(s). Failure to comply with this rule shall have no effect on the disposition of the charge(s) if the charge(s) is not referred to a general court-martial.</p>
<section class="level4" id="discussion-102">
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>The function of the preliminary hearing is to ascertain and impartially weigh the facts needed for the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing. The preliminary hearing is not intended to perfect a case against the accused and is not intended to serve as a means of discovery or to provide a right of confrontation required at trial. Determinations and recommendations of the preliminary hearing officer are advisory. Failure to substantially comply with the requirements of Article 32, which failure prejudices the accused, may result in delay in disposition of the case or disapproval of the proceedings. See R.C.M. 905(b)(1) and 906(b)(3) concerning motions for appropriate relief relating to the preliminary hearing. The accused may waive the preliminary hearing. See subsection (k) of this rule. In such case, no preliminary hearing need be held. However, the convening authority authorized to direct the preliminary hearing may direct that it be conducted notwithstanding the waiver.</p>

<p>A commanding officer's determination of whether an individual is available, as well as the means by which the individual is available, is a balancing test.

Factors to be considered in making this determination include the costs of producing the witness; the timing of the request for production of the witness; the potential delay in the proceeding that may be caused by the production of the witness; and the likelihood of significant interference with operational deployment, mission accomplishment, or essential training.</p>

<h5>Discussion</h5>
<p>Before considering evidence offered under subsection (h)(2), the preliminary hearing officer must determine that the evidence offered is relevant for the limited scope and purpose of the hearing, that the evidence is proper under subsection (h)(2), and that the probative value of such evidence outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice to the alleged victim's privacy. The preliminary hearing officer shall set forth any limitations on the scope of such evidence. Evidence offered under subsection (h)(2) above must be protected pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a. Although Mil. R. Evid. 412(b)(1)(C) allows admission of evidence of the victim's sexual behavior or predisposition at trial when it is constitutionally required, there is no constitutional requirement at an Article 32 hearing. There is likewise no constitutional requirement for a pretrial hearing officer to consider evidence under Mil. R. Evid. 514(d)(6) at an Article 32 hearing. Evidence deemed admissible by the preliminary hearing officer should be made a part of the report of preliminary hearing. <em>See</em> subsection (j)(2)(C), <em>infra</em>. Evidence not considered, and the testimony taken during a closed hearing, should not be included in the report of preliminary hearing but should be appropriately safeguarded or sealed.

Counsel for the government will then present evidence. Upon the conclusion of counsel for the government's presentation of evidence, defense counsel may present matters in defense and mitigation consistent with subsection (f) of this rule. For the purposes of this rule, "matters in mitigation" are defined as matters that may serve to explain the circumstances surrounding a charged offense. Both counsel for the government and defense shall be afforded an opportunity to cross-examine adverse witnesses. The preliminary hearing officer may also question witnesses called by the parties. If the preliminary hearing officer determines that additional evidence is necessary to satisfy the requirements of subsection (e) above, the preliminary hearing officer may provide the parties an opportunity to present additional testimony or evidence relevant to the limited scope and purpose of the preliminary hearing.

<p>The following oath may be given to witnesses: "Do you (swear) (affirm) that the evidence you give shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth (so help you God)?" The preliminary hearing officer is required to include in the report of the preliminary hearing, at a minimum, a summary of the substance of all testimony. See subsection (j)(2)(B) of this rule. All preliminary hearing officer notes of testimony and recordings of testimony should be preserved until the end of trial. If during the preliminary hearing any witness subject to the Code is suspected of an offense under the Code, the preliminary hearing officer should comply with the warning requirements of Mil. R. Evid. 305(c), (d), and, if necessary, (e). Bearing in mind that counsel are responsible for preparing and presenting their cases, the preliminary hearing officer may ask a witness questions relevant to the limited scope and purpose of the hearing.

<h4>(4) Access by spectators.</h4>
<p>Access by spectators to all or part of the proceedings may be restricted or foreclosed in the discretion of the convening authority who directed the preliminary hearing or the preliminary hearing officer. Preliminary hearings are public proceedings and should remain open to the public whenever possible. When an overriding interest exists that outweighs the value of an open preliminary hearing, the preliminary hearing may be closed to spectators. Any closure must be narrowly tailored to achieve the overriding interest that justified the closure. Convening authorities or preliminary hearing officers must conclude that no lesser methods short of closing the preliminary hearing can be used to protect the overriding interest in the case. Convening authorities or preliminary hearing officers must conduct a case-by-case, witness-by-witness, circumstance-by-circumstance analysis of whether closure is necessary. If a convening authority or preliminary hearing officer believes closing the preliminary hearing is necessary, the convening authority or preliminary hearing officer must make specific findings of fact in writing that support the closure. The written findings of fact must be included in the report of preliminary hearing. Examples of overriding interests may include: preventing psychological harm or trauma to a child witness or an alleged victim of a sexual crime, protecting the safety or privacy of a witness or alleged victim, protecting classified material, and receiving evidence where a witness is incapable of testifying in an open setting.</p>

<p>A pretrial advice need not be prepared in cases referred to special or summary courts-martial.

When charges have been withdrawn from a general court-martial (<em>see</em> R.C.M. 604) or when a mistrial has been declared in a general court-martial (<em> see</em> R.C.M. 915), supplementary advice is necessary before the charges may be referred to another general court-martial.

<section class="level5" id="discussion-118">
<h5>Discussion</h5>
<p>The staff judge advocate is personally responsible for the pretrial advice and must make an independent and informed appraisal of the charges and evidence in order to render the advice. Another person may prepare the advice, but the staff judge advocate is, unless disqualified, responsible for it and must sign it personally. Grounds for disqualification in a case include previous action in that case as preliminary hearing officer, military judge, trial counsel, defense counsel, or member. The advice need not set forth the underlying analysis or rationale for its conclusions. Ordinarily, the charge sheet, forwarding letter, endorsements, and report of investigation are forwarded with the pretrial advice. In addition, the pretrial advice should include when appropriate: a brief summary of the evidence; discussion of significant aggravating, extenuating, or mitigating factors; any recommendations for disposition of the case by commanders or others who have forwarded the charges; and the recommendation of the Article 32 preliminary hearing officer. However, there is no legal requirement to include such information, and failure to do so is not error. Whatever matters are included in the advice, whether or not they are required, should be accurate. Information which is incorrect or so incomplete as to be misleading may result in a determination that the advice is defective, necessitating appropriate relief. <em> See</em> R.C.M. 905(b)(1); 906(b)(3). The standard of proof to be applied in R.C.M. 406(b)(2) is probable cause. <em>See</em> R.C.M. 601(d)(1). Defects in the pretrial advice are not jurisdictional and are raised by pretrial motion. <em>See</em> R.C.M.905(b)(1) and its Discussion.</p>

<h5>Discussion</h5>
<p>Referral is ordinarily evidenced by an indorsement on the charge sheet. Although the indorsement should be completed on all copies of the charge sheet, only the original must be signed. The signature may be that of a person acting by the order or direction of the convening authority. In such a case the signature element must reflect the signer's authority. If, for any reason, charges are referred to a court-martial different from that to which they were originally referred, the new referral is ordinarily made by a new indorsement attached to the original charge sheet. The previous indorsement should be lined out and initialed by the person signing the new referral. The original indorsement should not be obliterated. <em>See also</em> R.C.M. 604. If the only officer present in a command refers the charges to a summary court-martial and serves as the summary court-martial under R.C.M. 1302, the indorsement should be completed with the additional comments, "only officer present in the command." The convening authority may instruct that the charges against the accused be tried with certain other charges against the accused. <em>See</em> subsection</p>
<ol type="1" start="2">
<li>below. The convening authority may instruct that charges against one accused be referred for joint or common trial with another accused. <em> See</em> subsection (3) below. The convening authority shall indicate that the case is to be tried as a capital case by including a special instruction in the referral block of the charge sheet. Failure to include this special instruction at the time of the referral shall not bar the convening authority from later adding the required special instruction, provided that the convening authority has otherwise complied with the applicable notice requirements. If the accused demonstrates specific prejudice from such failure to include the special instruction, a continuance or a recess is an adequate remedy. The convening authority should acknowledge by an instruction that a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for more than six months, or forfeiture of pay for more than six months, may not be adjudged when the prerequisites under Article 19 will not be met. <em>See</em> R.C.M. 201(f)(2)(B)(ii). For example, this instruction may be given when a court reporter is not detailed. Any special instructions must be stated in the referral indorsement.

<p>Parallel convening authorities are those convening authorities that possess the same court-martial jurisdiction authority.

It would be impracticable for an original convening authority to continue exercising authority over the charges, for example, when a command is being decommissioned or inactivated, or when deploying or redeploying and the accused is remaining behind. If charges have been referred, there is no requirement that the charges be withdrawn or dismissed prior to transfer. <em>See</em> R.C.M. 604. In the event that the case has been referred, the receiving convening authority may adopt the original court-martial convening order, including the court-martial panel selected to hear the case as indicated in that convening order.

In time of peace, no person may, over objection, be brought to trial-including an Article 39(a) session-before a general court-martial within a period of five days after service of charges, or before a special court-martial within a period of three days after service of charges.

<p>Trial counsel should comply with this rule immediately upon receipt of the charges.

Whenever such amendments or changes add a new party, a new offense, or substantially new allegations, the charge sheet so amended or changed must be served anew. <em> See also</em> R.C.M. 603. Service may be made only upon the accused; substitute service upon defense counsel is insufficient. The trial counsel should promptly inform the defense counsel when charges have been served.

<p>If there has been a major change or amendment over the accused's objection to a charge already referred, a new referral is necessary. Similarly, in the case of a general court-martial, a new investigation under R.C.M. 405 will be necessary if the charge as amended or changed was not covered in the prior investigation. If the substance of the charge or specification as amended or changed has not been referred or, in the case of a general court-martial, investigated, a new referral and, if appropriate, investigation are necessary.

<h2>Rule 604. Withdrawal of charges</h2>
<section class="level3" id="a-withdrawal.">
<h3>(a) Withdrawal.</h3>
<p>The convening authority or a superior competent authority may for any reason cause any charges or specifications to be withdrawn from a court-martial at any time before findings are announced.</p>
<section class="level4" id="discussion-167">
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>Charges which are withdrawn from a court-martial should be dismissed</p>
<p>(<em>see</em> R.C.M. 401(c)(1)) unless it is intended to refer them anew promptly or to forward them to another authority for disposition. Charges should not be withdrawn from a court-martial arbitrarily or unfairly to an accused. <em>See also</em> subsection (b) of this rule. Some or all charges and specifications may be withdrawn. In a joint or common trial the withdrawal may be limited to charges against one or some of the accused. Charges which have been properly referred to a court-martial may be withdrawn only by the direction of the convening authority or a superior competent authority in the exercise of that officer's independent judgment. When directed to do so by the convening authority or a superior competent authority, trial counsel may withdraw charges or specifications by lining out the affected charges or specifications, renumbering remaining charges or specifications as necessary, and initialing the changes. Charges and specifications withdrawn before commencement of trial will not be brought to the attention of the members. When charges or specifications are withdrawn after they have come to the attention of the members, the military judge must instruct them that the withdrawn charges or specifications may not be considered for any reason.</p>

<section class="level3" id="b-referral-of-withdrawn-charges.">
<h3>(b) Referral of withdrawn charges.</h3>
<p>Charges which have been withdrawn from a court-martial may be referred to another court-martial unless the withdrawal was for an improper reason. Charges withdrawn after the introduction of evidence on the general issue of guilt may be referred to another court-martial only if the withdrawal was necessitated by urgent and unforeseen military necessity.</p>
<section class="level4" id="discussion-168">
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p><em>See also</em> R.C.M. 915 (Mistrial). When charges which have been withdrawn from a court-martial are referred to another court-martial, the reasons for the withdrawal and later referral should be included in the record of the later court-martial, if the later referral is more onerous to the accused. Therefore, if further prosecution is contemplated at the time of the withdrawal, the reasons for the withdrawal should be included in or attached to the record of the earlier proceeding. Improper reasons for withdrawal include an intent to interfere with the free exercise by the accused of constitutional rights or rights provided under the code, or with the impartiality of a court-martial. A withdrawal is improper if it was not directed personally and independently by the convening authority or by a superior competent authority. Whether the reason for a withdrawal is proper, for purposes of the propriety of a later referral, depends in part on the stage in the proceedings at which the withdrawal takes place. Before arraignment, there are many reasons for a withdrawal which will not preclude another referral. These include receipt of additional charges, absence of the accused, reconsideration by the convening authority or by a superior competent authority of the seriousness of the offenses, questions concerning the mental capacity of the accused, and routine duty rotation of the personnel constituting the court-martial. Charges withdrawn after arraignment may be referred to another court-martial under some circumstances. For example, it is permissible to refer charges which were withdrawn pursuant to a pretrial agreement if the accused fails to fulfill the terms of the agreement. <em>See</em> R.C.M. 705. Charges withdrawn after some evidence on the general issue of guilty is introduced may be re-referred only under the narrow circumstances described in the rule.</p>

<h3>(a) In general.</h3>
<p>A deposition may be ordered whenever, after preferral of charges, due to exceptional circumstances of the case it is in the interest of justice that the testimony of a prospective witness be taken and preserved for use at a preliminary hearing under Article 32 or a court-martial. A victim's declination to testify at a preliminary hearing or a victim's declination to submit to pretrial interviews shall not, by themselves, be considered exceptional circumstances. In accordance with subsection (b) of this rule below, the convening authority or military judge may order a deposition of a victim only if it is determined, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the victim will not be available to testify at court-martial.</p>
<section class="level4" id="discussion-177">
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>A deposition is the out-of-court testimony of a witness under oath in response to questions by the parties, which is reduced to writing or recorded on videotape or audiotape or similar material. A deposition taken on oral examination is an oral deposition, and a deposition taken on written interrogatories is a written deposition. Written interrogatories are questions, prepared by the prosecution, defense, or both, which are reduced to writing before submission to a witness whose testimony is to be taken by deposition. The answers, reduced to writing and properly sworn to, constitute the deposition testimony of the witness. Note that under subsection (i) of this rule a deposition may be taken by agreement of the parties without necessity of an order. A deposition may be taken to preserve the testimony of a witness who is likely to be unavailable at the investigation under Article 32 (<em>see</em> R.C.M. 405(g)) or at the time of trial</p>
<p>(<em>see</em> R.C.M. 703(b)). Part of all or a deposition, so far as otherwise admissible under the Military Rules of Evidence, may be used on the merits or on an interlocutory question as substantive evidence if the witness is unavailable under Mil. R. Evid. 804(a) except that a deposition may be admitted in a capital case only upon offer by the defense. <em> See</em> Mil. R. Evid. 804(b)(1). In any case, a deposition may be used by any party for the purpose of contradicting or impeaching the testimony of the deponent as a witness. <em>See</em> Mil. R. Evid. 613. If only a part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, an adverse party may require the proponent to offer all which is relevant to the part offered, and any party may offer other parts. <em>See</em> Mil. R. Evid. 106. A deposition which is transcribed is ordinarily read to the court-martial by the party offering it. <em>See also</em> subsection</p>
<p>(g)(3) of this rule. The transcript of a deposition may not be inspected by the members. Objections may be made to testimony in a written deposition in the same way that they would be if the testimony were offered through the personal appearance of a witness. Part or all of a deposition so far as otherwise admissible under the Military Rules of Evidence may be used in presentencing proceedings as substantive evidence as provided in R.C.M. 1001.

<h4>(1) On the merits or on interlocutory questions.</h4>
<p>Each party is entitled to the production of any witness whose testimony on a matter in issue on the merits or on an interlocutory question would be relevant and necessary. With the consent of both the accused and Government, the military judge may authorize any witness to testify via remote means. Over a party's objection, the military judge may authorize any witness to testify on interlocutory questions via remote means or similar technology if the practical difficulties of producing the witness outweigh the significance of the witness' personal appearance (although such testimony will not be admissible over the accused's objection as evidence on the ultimate issue of guilt). Factors to be considered include, but are not limited to: the costs of producing the witness; the timing of the request for production of the witness; the potential delay in the interlocutory proceeding that may be caused by the production of the witness; the willingness of the witness to testify in person; the likelihood of significant interference with military operational deployment, mission accomplishment, or essential training; and, for child witnesses, the traumatic effect of providing in-court testimony.</p>
<section class="level5" id="discussion-189">
<h5>Discussion</h5>
<p><em>See</em> Mil. R. Evid. 401 concerning relevance. Relevant testimony is necessary when it is not cumulative and when it would contribute to a party's presentation of the case in some positive way on a matter in issue. A matter is not in issue when it is stipulated as a fact. The procedures for receiving testimony via remote means and the definition thereof are contained in R.C.M. 914B. An issue may arise as both an interlocutory question and a question that bears on the ultimate issue of guilt. See R.C.M. 801(e)(5). In such circumstances, this rule authorizes the admission of testimony by remote means or similar technology over the accused's objection only as evidence on the interlocutory question. In most instances, testimony taken over a party's objection will not be admissible as evidence on the question that bears on the ultimate issue of guilt; however, there may be certain limited circumstances where the testimony is admissible on the ultimate issue of guilt. Such determinations must be made based upon the relevant rules of evidence.</p>

The return envelope should be addressed to the person who issued the subpoena. The person who issued the subpoena should include with it a statement to the effect that the rights of the witness to fees and mileage will not be impaired by voluntary compliance with the request and that a voucher for fees and mileage will be delivered to the witness promptly on being discharged from attendance. <em>Formal service.</em> Formal service is advisable whenever it is anticipated that the witness will not comply voluntarily with the subpoena. Appropriate fees and mileage must be paid or tendered. <em>See</em> Article 47. If formal service is advisable, the person who issued the subpoena must assure timely and economical service. That person may do so by serving the subpoena personally when the witness is in the vicinity. When the witness is not in the vicinity, the subpoena may be sent in duplicate to the commander of a military installation near the witness. Such commanders should give prompt and effective assistance, issuing travel orders for their personnel to serve the subpoena when necessary. Service should ordinarily be made by a person subject to the code. The duplicate copy of the subpoena must have entered upon it proof of service as indicated on the form and must be promptly returned to the person who issued the subpoena. If service cannot be made, the person who issued the subpoena must be informed promptly. A stamped, addressed envelope should be provided for these purposes.

<section class="level7" id="discussion-196">
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>A warrant of attachment (DD Form 454) may be used when necessary to compel a witness to appear or produce evidence under this rule. A warrant of attachment is a legal order addressed to an official directing that official to have the person named in the order brought before a court. Subpoenas issued under R.C.M. 703 are Federal process and a person not subject to the code may be prosecuted in a Federal civilian court under Article 47 for failure to comply with a subpoena issued in compliance with this rule and formally served. Failing to comply with such a subpoena is a felony offense, and may result in a fine or imprisonment, or both, at the discretion of the district court. The different purposes of the warrant of attachment and criminal complaint under Article 47 should be borne in mind. The warrant of attachment, available without the intervention of civilian judicial proceedings, has as its purpose the obtaining of the witness's presence, testimony, or documents. The criminal complaint, prosecuted through the civilian Federal courts, has as its purpose punishment for failing to comply with process issued by military authority. It serves to vindicate the military interest in obtaining compliance with its lawful process. For subpoenas issued for a pretrial investigation pursuant to Article 32 under subsection (f)(4)(B), the general court-martial convening authority with jurisdiction over the case may issue a warrant of attachment to compel production of documents.</p>

<h2>Rule 704. Immunity</h2>
<section class="level3" id="a-types-of-immunity.">
<h3>(a) Types of immunity.</h3>
<p>Two types of immunity may be granted under this rule.</p>
<section class="level4" id="transactional-immunity.">
<h4>(1) Transactional immunity.</h4>
<p>A person may be granted transactional immunity from trial by court-martial for one or more offenses under the code.</p>
</section>
<section class="level4" id="testimonial-immunity.">
<h4>(2) Testimonial immunity.</h4>
<p>A person may be granted immunity from the use of testimony, statements, and any information directly or indirectly derived from such testimony or statements by that person in a later court-martial.</p>
<section class="level5" id="discussion-200">
<h5>Discussion</h5>
<p>"Testimonial" immunity is also called "use" immunity. Immunity ordinarily should be granted only when testimony or other information from the person is necessary to the public interest, including the needs of good order and discipline, and when the person has refused or is likely to refuse to testify or provide other information on the basis of the privilege against self-incrimination. Testimonial immunity is preferred because it does not bar prosecution of the person for the offenses about which testimony or information is given under the grant of immunity. In any trial of a person granted testimonial immunity after the testimony or information is given, the Government must meet a heavy burden to show that it has not used in any way for the prosecution of that person the person's statements, testimony, or information derived from them. In many cases this burden makes difficult a later prosecution of such a person for any offense that was the subject of that person's testimony or statements. Therefore, if it is intended to prosecute a person to whom testimonial immunity has been or will be granted for offenses about which that person may testify or make statements, it may be necessary to try that person before the testimony or statements are given.</p>

<h3>(c) Authority to grant immunity.</h3>

<section class="level4" id="discussion-201">
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>Only general court-martial convening authorities are authorized to grant immunity. However, in some circumstances, when a person testifies or makes statements pursuant to a promise of immunity, or a similar promise, by a person with apparent authority to make it, such testimony or statements and evidence derived from them may be inadmissible in a later trial. Under some circumstances a promise of immunity by someone other than a general court-martial convening authority may bar prosecution altogether. Persons not authorized to grant immunity should exercise care when dealing with accused or suspects to avoid inadvertently causing statements to be inadmissible or prosecution to be barred. A convening authority who grants immunity to a prosecution witness in a court-martial may be disqualified from taking post-trial action in the case under some circumstances.</p>

<section class="level5" id="discussion-202">
<h5>Discussion</h5>
<p>When testimony or a statement for which a person subject to the code may be granted immunity may relate to an offense for which that person could be prosecuted in a United States District Court, immunity should not be granted without prior coordination with the Department of Justice. Ordinarily coordination with the local United States Attorney is appropriate. Unless the Department of Justice indicates it has no interest in the case, authorization for the grant of immunity should be sought from the Attorney General. A request for such authorization should be forwarded through the office of the Judge Advocate General concerned. Service regulations may provide additional guidance. Even if the Department of Justice expresses no interest in the case, authorization by the Attorney General for the grant of immunity may be necessary to compel the person to testify or make a statement if such testimony or statement would make the person liable for a Federal civilian offense.</p>

<p>A person who has received a valid grant of immunity from a proper authority may be ordered to testify. In addition, a servicemember who has received a valid grant of immunity may be ordered to answer questions by investigators or counsel pursuant to that grant. <em>See</em> Mil. R. Evid. 301(c). A person who refuses to testify despite a valid grant of immunity may be prosecuted for such refusal. Persons subject to the code may be charged under Article 134. <em>See</em> paragraph 108, Part IV. A grant of immunity removes the right to refuse to testify or make a statement on self-incrimination grounds. It does not, however, remove other privileges against disclosure of information. <em>See</em> Mil. R. Evid., Section V. An immunity order or grant must not specify the contents of the testimony it is expected the witness will give.

<p>The decision to grant or deny a reasonable delay is a matter within the sole discretion of the convening authority or a military judge. This decision should be based on the facts and circumstances then and there existing. Reasons to grant a delay might, for example, include the need for: time to enable counsel to prepare for trial in complex cases; time to allow examination into the mental capacity of the accused; time to process a member of the reserve component to active duty for disciplinary action; time to complete other proceedings related to the case; time requested by the defense; time to secure the availability of the accused, substantial witnesses, or other evidence; time to obtain appropriate security clearances for access to classified information or time to declassify evidence; or additional time for other good cause. Pretrial delays should not be granted ex parte, and when practicable, the decision granting the delay, together with supporting reasons and the dates covering the delay, should be reduced to writing.

<section class="level5" id="discussion-232">
<h5>Discussion</h5>
<p>A ruling on an interlocutory question should be preceded by any necessary inquiry into the pertinent facts and law. For example, the party making the objection, motion, or request may be required to furnish evidence or legal authority in support of the contention. An interlocutory issue may have a different standard of proof. <em>See</em>, for example, Mil. R. Evid. 314(e)(5), which requires consent for a search to be proved by clear and convincing evidence. Most of the common motions are discussed in specific rules in this Manual, and the burden of persuasion is assigned therein. The prosecution usually bears the burden of persuasion</p>
<p>(<em>see</em> Mil. R. Evid. 304(e); 311(e); <em>see also</em> R.C.M. 905 through 907) once an issue has been raised. What "raises" an issue may vary with the issue. Some issues may be raised by a timely motion or objection. <em>See</em>, for example, Mil. R. Evid. 304(e). Others may not be raised until the defense has made an offer of proof or presented evidence in support of its position. <em>See</em>, for example, Mil. R. Evid. 311(g)(2). The rules in this Manual and relevant decisions should be consulted when a question arises as to whether an issue is raised, as well as which side has the burden of persuasion. The military judge or president of a special court-martial may require a party to clarify a motion or objection or to make an offer of proof, regardless of the burden of persuasion, when it appears that the motion or objection is vague, inapposite, irrelevant, or spurious.</p>

<section class="level4" id="scope.-1">
<h4>(5) Scope.</h4>
<p>Subsection (e) of this rule applies to the disposition of questions of law and interlocutory questions arising during trial except the question whether a challenge should be sustained.</p>
<section class="level5" id="discussion-233">
<h5>Discussion</h5>
<p>Questions of law and interlocutory questions include all issues which arise during trial other than the findings (that is, guilty or not guilty), sentence, and administrative matters such as declaring recesses and adjournments. A question may be both interlocutory and a question of law. Challenges are specifically covered in R.C.M. 902 and 912. Questions of the applicability of a rule of law to an undisputed set of facts are normally questions of law. Similarly, the legality of an act is normally a question of law. For example, the legality of an order when disobedience of an order is charged, the legality of restraint when there is a prosecution for breach of arrest, or the sufficiency of warnings before interrogation are normally questions of law. It is possible, however, for such questions to be decided solely upon some factual issue, in which case they would be questions of fact. For example, the question of what warnings, if any, were given by an interrogator to a suspect would be a factual question. A question is interlocutory unless the ruling on it would finally decide whether the accused is guilty. Questions which may determine the ultimate issue of guilt are not interlocutory. An issue may arise as both an interlocutory question and a question which may determine the ultimate issue of guilt. An issued is not purely interlocutory if an accused raises a defense or objection and the disputed facts involved determine the ultimate question of guilt. For example, if during a trial for desertion the accused moves to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and presents some evidence that the accused is not a member of an armed force, the accused's status as a military person may determine the ultimate question of guilt because status is an element of the offense. If the motion is denied, the disputed facts must be resolved by each member in deliberation upon the findings. (The accused's status as a servicemember would have to be proved by a preponderance of the evidence to uphold jurisdiction, _ see_ R.C.M. 907, but beyond a reasonable doubt to permit a finding of guilty.) If, on the other hand, the accused was charged with larceny and presented the same evidence as to military status, the evidence would bear only upon amenability to trial and the issue would be disposed of solely as an interlocutory question. Interlocutory questions may be questions of fact or questions of law. This distinction is important because the president of a special court-martial without a military judge rules finally on interlocutory questions of law, but not on interlocutory questions of fact.

<section class="level4" id="discussion-235">
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>Conferences between the military judge and counsel may be held when necessary before or during trial. The purpose of such conference is to inform the military judge of anticipated issues and to expeditiously resolve matters on which the parties can agree, not to litigate or decide contested issues. <em> See</em> subsection (c) below. No party may be compelled to resolve any matter at a conference. A conference may be appropriate in order to resolve scheduling difficulties, so that witnesses and members are not unnecessarily inconvenienced. Matters which will ultimately be in the military judge's discretion, such as conduct of voir dire, seating arrangements in the courtroom, or procedures when there are multiple accused may be resolved at a conference. Conferences may be used to advise the military judge of issues or problems, such as unusual motions or objections, which are likely to arise during trial. Occasionally it may be appropriate to resolve certain issues, in addition to routine or administrative matters, if this can be done with the consent of the parties. For example, a request for a witness which, if litigated and approved at trial, would delay the proceedings and cause expense or inconvenience, might be resolved at a conference. Note, however, that this could only be done by an agreement of the parties and not by a binding ruling of the military judge. Such a resolution must be included in the record. <em>See</em> subsection (b) below. A military judge may not participate in negotiations relating to pleas. <em> See</em> R.C.M. 705 and Mil. R.

<section class="level3" id="discussion-237">
<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>The purpose of Article 39(a) is "to give statutory sanction to pretrial and other hearings without the presence of the members concerning those matters which are amenable to disposition on either a tentative or final basis by the military judge." The military judge and members may, and ordinarily should, call the court-martial into session without members to ascertain the accused's understanding of the right to counsel, the right to request trial by military judge alone, or when applicable, enlisted members, and the accused's choices with respect to these matters; dispose of interlocutory matters; hear objections and motions; rule upon other matters that may legally be ruled upon by the military judge, such as admitting evidence; and perform other procedural functions which do not require the presence of members. <em> See</em>, for example, R.C.M. 901-910. The military judge may, if permitted by regulations of the Secretary concerned, hold the arraignment, receive pleas, and enter findings of guilty upon an accepted plea of guilty. Evidence may be admitted and process, including a subpoena, may be issued to compel attendance of witnesses and production of evidence at such sessions. <em> See</em> R.C.M. 703. Article 39(a) authorizes sessions only after charges have been referred to trial and served on the accused, but the accused has an absolute right to object, in time of peace, to any session until the period prescribed by Article 35 has run. <em> See</em> R.C.M. 804 concerning waiver by the accused of the right to be present. <em>See also</em> R.C.M. 802 concerning conferences.</p>

<h6>Discussion</h6>
<p><em>Express waiver.</em> The accused may expressly waive the right to be present at trial proceedings. There is no right to be absent, however, and the accused may be required to be present over objection. Thus, an accused cannot frustrate efforts to identify the accused at trial by waiving the right to be present. The right to be present is so fundamental, and the Government's interest in the attendance of the accused so substantial, that the accused should be permitted to waive the right to be present only for good cause, and only after the military judge explains to the accused the right, and the consequences of foregoing it, and secures the accused's personal consent to proceeding without the accused. <em>Voluntary absence.</em> In any case the accused may forfeit the right to be present by being voluntarily absent after arraignment. "Voluntary absence" means voluntary absence from trial. For an absence from court-martial proceedings to be voluntary, the accused must have known of the scheduled proceedings and intentionally missed them. For example, although an accused servicemember might voluntarily be absent without authority, this would not justify proceeding with a court-martial in the accused's absence unless the accused was aware that the court-martial would be held during the period of the absence. An accused who is in military custody or otherwise subject to military control at the time of trial or other proceeding may not properly be absent from the trial or proceeding without securing the permission of the military judge on the record. The prosecution has the burden to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the accused's absence from trial is voluntary. Voluntariness may not be presumed, but it may be inferred, depending on the circumstances. For example, it may be inferred, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that an accused who was present when the trial recessed and who knew when the proceedings were scheduled to resume, but who nonetheless is not present when court reconvenes at the designated time, is absent voluntarily. Where there is some evidence that an accused who is absent for a hearing or trial may lack mental capacity to stand trial, capacity to voluntarily waive the right to be present for trial must be shown. <em>See</em> R.C.M. 909. Subsection</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>authorizes but does not require trial to proceed in the absence of the accused upon the accused's voluntary absence. When an accused is absent from trial after arraignment, a continuance or a recess may be appropriate, depending on all the circumstances. Presence of the accused by remote means does not require the consent of the accused. <em>Removal for disruption. </em> Trial may proceed without the presence of an accused who has disrupted the proceedings, but only after at least one warning by the military judge that such behavior may result in removal from the courtroom. In order to justify removal from the proceedings, the accused's behavior should be of such a nature as to materially interfere with the conduct of the proceedings. The military judge should consider alternatives to removal of a disruptive accused. Such alternatives include physical restraint (such as binding, shackling, and gagging) of the accused, or physically segregating the accused in the courtroom. Such alternatives need not be tried before removing a disruptive accused under subsection (2). Removal may be preferable to such an alternative as binding and gagging, which can be an affront to the dignity and decorum of the proceedings. Disruptive behavior of the accused may also constitute contempt. <em>See</em> R.C.M. 809. When the accused is removed from the courtroom for disruptive behavior, the military judge should-</li>

<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>Because of the requirement for public trials, courts-martial must be conducted in facilities which can accommodate a reasonable number of spectators. Military exigencies may occasionally make attendance at courts-martial difficult or impracticable, as, for example, when a court-martial is conducted on a ship at sea or in a unit in a combat zone. This does not violate this rule. However, such exigencies should not be manipulated to prevent attendance at a court-martial. The requirements of this rule may be met even though only servicemembers are able to attend a court-martial. Although not required, servicemembers should be encouraged to attend courts-martial. When public access to a court-martial is limited for some reason, including lack of space, special care must be taken to avoid arbitrary exclusion of specific groups or persons. This may include allocating a reasonable number of seats to members of the press and to relatives of the accused, and establishing procedures for entering and exiting from the courtroom. <em>See also </em> subsection (b) below. There is no requirement that there actually be spectators at a court-martial. The fact that a trial is conducted with members does not make it a public trial.</p>

When excluding specific persons, the military judge must make findings on the record establishing the reason for the exclusion, the basis for the military judge's belief that exclusion is necessary, and that the exclusion is as narrowly tailored as possible.</p>
<section class="level5" id="discussion-243">
<h5>Discussion</h5>
<p>The military judge must ensure that the dignity and decorum of the proceedings are maintained and that the other rights and interests of the parties and society are protected. Public access to a session may be limited, specific persons may be excluded from the courtroom, and, under unusual circumstances, a session may be closed. Exclusion of specific persons, if unreasonable under the circumstances, may violate the accused's right to a public trial, even though other spectators remain. Whenever specific persons or some members of the public are excluded, exclusion must be limited in time and scope to the minimum extent necessary to achieve the purpose for which it is ordered. Prevention of over- crowding or noise may justify limiting access to the courtroom. Disruptive or distracting appearance or conduct may justify excluding specific persons. Specific persons may be excluded when necessary to protect witnesses from harm or intimidation. Access may be reduced when no other means is available to relieve a witness' inability to testify due to embarrassment or extreme nervousness. Witnesses will ordinarily be excluded from the courtroom so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses. <em>See</em> Mil. R. Evid. 615.

<section class="level4" id="discussion-244">
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>The military judge is responsible for protecting both the accused's right to, and the public's interest in, a public trial. A court-martial session is "closed" when no member of the public is permitted to attend. A court-martial is not "closed" merely because the exclusion of certain individuals results in there being no spectators present, as long as the exclusion is not so broad as to effectively bar everyone who might attend the sessions and is put into place for a proper purpose. A session may be closed over the objection of the accused or the public upon meeting the constitutional standard set forth in this Rule. <em>See also </em> Mil. R. Evid. 412(c), 505(i), and 513(e)(2). The accused may waive his right to a public trial. The fact that the prosecution and defense jointly seek to have a session closed does not, however, automatically justify closure, for the public has a right in attending courts-martial. Opening trials to public scrutiny reduces the chance of arbitrary and capricious decisions and enhances public confidence in the court-martial process. The most likely reason for a defense request to close court-martial proceedings is to minimize the potentially adverse effect of publicity on the trial. For example, a pretrial Article 39(a) hearing at which the admissibility of a confession will be litigated may, under some circumstances, be closed, in accordance with this Rule, in order to prevent disclosure to the public (and hence to potential members) of the very evidence that may be excluded. When such publicity may be a problem, a session should be closed only as a last resort. There are alternative means of protecting the proceedings from harmful effects of publicity, including a thorough <em> voir dire</em> (<em>see</em> R.C.M. 912), and, if necessary, a continuance to allow the harmful effects of publicity to dissipate</p>
<p>(<em>see</em> R.C.M. 906(b)(1)). Alternatives that may occasionally be appropriate and are usually preferable to closing a session include: directing members not to read, listen to, or watch any accounts concerning the case; issuing a protective order (<em>see</em> R.C.M. 806(d)); selecting members from recent arrivals in the command, or from outside the immediate area</p>
<p>(<em>see</em> R.C.M. 503(a)(3)); changing the place of trial</p>

<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>A protective order may proscribe extrajudicial statements by counsel, parties, and witnesses that might divulge prejudicial matter not of public record in the case. Other appropriate matters may also be addressed by such a protective order. Before issuing a protective order, the military judge must consider whether other available remedies would effectively mitigate the adverse effects that any publicity might create, and consider such an order's likely effectiveness in ensuring an impartial court-martial panel. A military judge should not issue a protective order without first providing notice to the parties and an opportunity to be heard. The military judge must state on the record the reasons for issuing the protective order.

<h2>Rule 809. Contempt proceedings</h2>
<section class="level3" id="a-in-general.-21">
<h3>(a) In general.</h3>
<p>Courts-martial may exercise contempt power under Article 48.</p>
<section class="level4" id="discussion-251">
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>Article 48 makes punishable "direct" contempt, as well as "indirect" or "constructive" contempt. "Direct" contempt is that which is committed in the presence of the court-martial or its immediate proximity. "Presence" includes those places outside the courtroom itself, such as waiting areas, deliberation rooms, and other places set aside for the use of the court-martial while it is in session. "Indirect" or "constructive" contempt is non-compliance with lawful writs, processes, orders, rules, decrees, or commands of the court-martial. A "direct" or "indirect" contempt may be actually seen or heard by the court-martial, in which case it may be punished summarily. <em>See</em> subsection (b)(1) below. A "direct" or "indirect" contempt may also be a contempt not actually observed by the court-martial, for example, when an unseen person makes loud noises, whether inside or outside the courtroom, which impede the orderly progress of the proceedings. In such a case the procedures for punishing for contempt are more extensive. <em>See</em> subsection (b)(2) below. The words "any person," as used in Article 48, include all persons, whether or not subject to military law, except the military judge, members, and foreign nationals outside the territorial limits of the United States who are not subject to the code. The military judge may order the offender removed whether or not contempt proceedings are held. It may be appropriate to warn a person whose conduct is improper that persistence in a course of behavior may result in removal or punishment for contempt. <em>See</em> R.C.M. 804, 806. Each contempt may be separately punished. A person subject to the code who commits contempt may be tried by court-martial or otherwise disciplined under Article 134 for such misconduct in addition to or instead of punishment for contempt. <em>See</em> paragraph 108, Part IV; <em>see also</em> Article 98. The 2011 amendment of Article 48 expanded the contempt power of military courts to enable them to enforce orders, such as discovery orders or protective orders regarding evidence, against military or civilian attorneys. Persons not subject to military jurisdiction under Article 2, having been duly subpoenaed, may be prosecuted in Federal civilian court under Article 47 for neglect or refusal to appear or refusal to qualify as a witness or to testify or to produce evidence.</p>

<p>Although the decision to stipulate should ordinarily be left to the parties, the military judge should not accept a stipulation if there is any doubt of the accused's or any other party's understanding of the nature and effect of the stipulation. The military judge should also refuse to accept a stipulation which is unclear or ambiguous. A stipulation of fact which amounts to a complete defense to any offense charged should not be accepted nor, if a plea of not guilty is outstanding, should one which practically amounts to a confession, except as described in the discussion under subsection</p>

<h3>(c) Requirements.</h3>
<p>Before accepting a stipulation in evidence, the military judge must be satisfied that the parties consent to its admission.</p>
<section class="level4" id="discussion-259">
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>Ordinarily, before accepting any stipulation the military judge should inquire to ensure that the accused understands the right not to stipulate, understands the stipulation, and consents to it. If the stipulation practically amounts to a confession to an offense to which a not guilty plea is outstanding, it may not be accepted unless the military judge ascertains: (A) from the accused that the accused understands the right not to stipulate and that the stipulation will not be accepted without the accused's consent; that the accused understands the contents and effect of the stipulation; that a factual basis exists for the stipulation; and that the accused, after consulting with counsel, consents to the stipulation; and (B) from the accused and counsel for each party whether there are any agreements between the parties in connection with the stipulation, and, if so, what the terms of such agreements are. A stipulation practically amounts to a confession when it is the equivalent of a guilty plea, that is, when it establishes, directly or by reasonable inference, every element of a charged offense and when the defense does not present evidence to contest any potential remaining issue of the merits. Thus, a stipulation which tends to establish, by reasonable inference, every element of a charged offense does not practically amount to a confession if the defense contests an issue going to guilt which is not foreclosed by the stipulation. For example, a stipulation of fact that contraband drugs were discovered in a vehicle owned by the accused would normally practically amount to a confession if no other evidence were presented on the issue, but would not if the defense presented evidence to show that the accused was unaware of the presence of the drugs. Whenever a stipulation establishes the elements of a charged offense, the military judge should conduct an inquiry as described above. If, during an inquiry into a confessional stipulation the military judge discovers that there is a pretrial agreement, the military judge must conduct an inquiry into the pretrial agreement. <em> See</em> R.C.M. 910(f). <em>See also</em> R.C.M. 705.</p>

In a joint or common trial, each accused may be represented by separate counsel, make challenges for cause, make peremptory challenges (<em>see</em> R.C.M. 912), cross-examine witnesses, elect whether to testify, introduce evidence, request that the membership of the court include enlisted persons, if an enlisted accused, and, if a military judge has been detailed, request trial by military judge alone. Where different elections are made</p>

Thus, if one co-accused elects to be tried by a court-martial composed of officers, and a second requests that enlisted members be detailed to the court, and a third submits a request for trial by military judge alone, which request is approved, three separate trials must be conducted. In a joint or common trial, evidence which is admissible against only one or some of the joint or several accused may be considered only against the accused concerned. For example, when a stipulation is accepted which was made by only one or some of the accused, the stipulation does not apply to those accused who did not join it. <em>See also</em> Mil. R.

<section class="level4" id="discussion-262">
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>The military judge should examine the charge sheet, convening order, and any amending orders before calling the initial session to order. Article 35 provides that in time of peace, no proceedings, including Article 39(a) sessions, may be conducted over the accused's objection until five days have elapsed from the service of charges on the accused in the case of a general court-martial. The period is three days for a special court-martial. In computing these periods, the date of service and the date of the proceedings are excluded. Holidays and Sundays are not excluded. Failure to object waives the right to the waiting period, but if it appears that the waiting period has not elapsed, the military judge should bring this to the attention of the defense and secure an affirmative waiver on the record.</p>

If any defense counsel is disqualified, the accused should be so informed. If the disqualification of trial or defense counsel is one which the accused may waive, the accused should be so informed by the military judge, and given the opportunity to decide whether to waive the disqualification. In the case of defense counsel, if the disqualification is not waivable or if the accused elects not to waive the disqualification, the accused should be informed of the choices available and given the opportunity to exercise such options. If any counsel is disqualified, the military judge should ensure that the accused is not prejudiced by any actions of the disqualified counsel or any break in representation of the accused. Disqualification of counsel is not a jurisdictional defect; such error must be tested for prejudice.

<h3>(g) Effect of final determinations.</h3>
<p>Any matter put in issue and finally determined by a court-martial, reviewing authority, or appellate court which had jurisdiction to determine the matter may not be disputed by the United States in any other court-martial of the same accused, except that, when the offenses charged at one court-martial did not arise out of the same transaction as those charged at the court-martial at which the determination was made, a determination of law and the application of law to the facts may be disputed by the United States. This rule also shall apply to matters which were put in issue and finally determined in any other judicial proceeding in which the accused and the United States or a Federal governmental unit were parties.</p>

<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p><em>See</em> also R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(C). Whether a matter has been finally determined in another judicial proceeding with jurisdiction to decide it, and whether such determination binds the United States in another proceeding are interlocutory questions. <em>See</em> R.C.M. 801(e). It does not matter whether the earlier proceeding ended in an acquittal, conviction, or otherwise, as long as the determination is final. Except for a ruling which is, or amounts to, a finding of not guilty, a ruling ordinarily is not final until action on the court-martial is completed. <em>See </em> Article 76; R.C.M. 1209. The accused is not bound in a court-martial by rulings in another court-martial. <em>But see</em> Article 3(b); R.C.M. 202. The determination must have been made by a court-martial, reviewing authority, or appellate court, or by another judicial body, such as a United States court. A pretrial determination by a convening authority is not a final determination under this rule, although some decisions by a convening authority may bind the Government under other rules. <em> See</em>, for example, R.C.M. 601, 604, 704, 705. The United States is bound by a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction even if the earlier determination is erroneous, except when the offenses charged at the second proceeding arose out of a different transaction from those charged at the first and the ruling at the first proceeding was based on an incorrect determination of law. A final determination in one case may be the basis for a motion to dismiss or a motion for appropriate relief in another case, depending on the circumstances. The nature of the earlier determination and the grounds for it will determine its effect in other proceedings. Examples:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The military judge dismissed a charge for lack of personal jurisdiction, on grounds that the accused was only 16 years old at the time of enlistment and when the offenses occurred. At a second court-martial of the same accused for a different offense, the determination in the first case would require dismissal of the new charge unless the prosecution could show that since that determination the accused had effected a valid enlistment or constructive enlistment. <em>See</em> R.C.M. 202. Note, however, that if the initial ruling had been based on an error of law (for example, if the military judge had ruled the enlistment invalid because the accused was 18 at the time of enlistment) this would not require dismissal in the second court-martial for a different offense.</p></li>
<li><p>The accused was tried in United States district court for assault on a Federal officer. The accused defended solely on the basis of alibi and was acquitted. The accused is then charged in a court-martial with assault on a different person at the same time and place as the assault on a Federal officer was alleged to have occurred. The acquittal of the accused in Federal district court would bar conviction of the accused in the court-martial. In cases of this nature, the facts of the first trial must be examined to determine whether the finding of the first trial is logically inconsistent with guilt in the second case.</p></li>
<li><p>At a court-martial for larceny, the military judge excluded evidence of a statement made by the accused relating to the larceny and other uncharged offenses because the statement was obtained by coercion. At a second court-martial for an unrelated offense, the statement excluded at the first trial would be inadmissible, based on the earlier ruling, if the first case had become final. If the earlier ruling had been based on an incorrect interpretation of law, however, the issue of admissibility could be litigated anew at the second proceeding.</p></li>
<li><p>At a court-martial for absence without authority, the charge and specification were dismissed for failure to state an offense. At a later court-martial for the same offense, the earlier dismissal would be grounds for dismissing the same charge and specification, but would not bar further proceedings on a new specification not containing the same defect as the original specification.</p></li>

<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>Unreasonable multiplication of charges as applied to findings and sentence is a limitation on the military's discretion to charge separate offenses and does not have a foundation in the Constitution. The concept is based on reasonableness and the prohibition against prosecutorial overreaching. In contrast, multiplicity is grounded in the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. It prevents an accused from being twice punished for one offense if it is contrary to the intent of Congress. <em>See</em> R.C.M. 907(b)(3). Therefore, a motion for relief from unreasonable multiplication of charges as applied to findings and sentence differs from a motion to dismiss on the grounds of multiplicity. The following non-exhaustive factors should be considered when determining whether two or more offenses are unreasonably multiplied: whether the specifications are aimed at distinctly separate criminal acts; whether they represent or exaggerate the accused's criminality; whether they unreasonably increase his or her exposure to punishment; and whether they suggest prosecutorial abuse of discretion in drafting of the specifications. Because prosecutors are permitted to plead in the alternative based on exigencies of proof, a ruling on this motion ordinarily should be deferred until after findings are entered.</p>

<p>Except for certain offenses for which there is either: no limitation as to time; or child abuse offenses for which a time limitation has been enacted and applies that is based upon the life of a child abuse victim, _ see_ Article 43(a) and (b)(2) , a person charged with an offense under the code may not be tried by court-martial over objection if sworn charges have not been received by the officer exercising summary court-martial jurisdiction over the command within five years. <em>See</em> Article 43(b). This period may be tolled (Article 43(c) and (d)), extended (Article 43(e) and (g)), or suspended (Article 43(f)) under certain circumstances. The prosecution bears the burden of proving that the statute of limitations has been tolled, extended, or suspended if it appears that is has run. Some offenses are continuing offenses and any period of the offense occurring within the statute of limitations is not barred. Absence without leave, desertion, and fraudulent enlistment are not continuing offenses and are committed, respectively, on the day the person goes absent, deserts, or first receives pay or allowances under the enlistment. When computing the statute of limitations, periods in which the accused was fleeing from justice or periods when the accused was absent without leave or in desertion are excluded. The military judge must determine by a preponderance, as an interlocutory matter, whether the accused was absent without authority or fleeing from justice. It would not be necessary that the accused be charged with the absence offense. In cases where the accused is charged with both an absence offense and a non-absence offense, but is found not guilty of the absence offense, the military judge would reconsider, by a preponderance, his or her prior determination whether that period of time is excludable. If sworn charges have been received by an officer exercising summary court-martial jurisdiction over the command within the period of the statute, minor amendments</p>
<p>(<em>see</em> R.C.M. 603(a)) may be made in the specification after the statute of limitations has run. However, if new charges are drafted or a major amendment made (<em>see</em> R.C.M. 603(d)) after the statute of limitations has run, prosecution is barred. The date of receipt of sworn charges is excluded when computing the appropriate statutory period. The date of the offense is included in the computation of the elapsed time. Article 43(g) allows the government time to reinstate charges dismissed as defective or insufficient for any cause. The government would have up to six months to reinstate the charges if the original period of limitations has expired or will expire within six months of the dismissal. In some cases, the issue whether the statute of limitations has run will depend on the findings on the general issue of guilt. For example, where the date of an offense is in dispute, a finding by the court-martial that the offense occurred at an earlier time may affect a determination as to the running of the statute of limitations.

A charge is multiplicious if the proof of such charge also proves every element of another charge.</p>
<section class="level6" id="discussion-312">
<h6>Discussion</h6>
<p>Multiplicity is a legal concept, arising from the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which provides that no person shall be put in jeopardy twice for the same offense. Absent legislative intent to the contrary, an accused cannot be convicted and punished for violations of two or more statutes if those violations arise from a single act. Where Congress intended to impose multiple punishments for the same act, imposition of such sentence does not violate the Constitution. Multiplicity differs from unreasonable multiplication of charges. If two offenses are not multiplicious, they nonetheless may constitute an unreasonable multiplication of charges as applied to findings or sentence. <em>See</em> R.C.M. 906(b)(12). Unreasonable multiplication of charges is a limitation on the military's discretion to charge separate offenses. It does not have a foundation in the Constitution; it is based on reasonableness and the prohibition against prosecutorial overreaching. The military judge is to determine, in his or her discretion, whether the charges constitute unreasonable multiplication of charges as applied to findings or sentencing. <em>See</em> R.C.M. 906(b)(12). To determine if two charges are multiplicious, the practitioner should first determine whether they are based on separate acts. If so, the charges are not multiplicious because separate acts may be charged and punished separately. If the charges are based upon a single act, the practitioner should next determine if Congress intended to impose multiple convictions and punishments for the same act. When there is no overt expression of congressional intent in the relevant statutes, such intent may be inferred based on the elements of the charged statutes and their relationship to each other or other principles of statutory interpretation. If each statute contains an element not contained in the other, it may be inferred that Congress intended they be charged and punished separately. Likewise, if each statute contains the same elements, it may be inferred that Congress did not intend they be charged and punished separately. A lesser included offense will always be multiplicious if charged separately, but offenses do not have to be lesser included to be multiplicious. Ordinarily, a specification should not be dismissed for multiplicity before trial. The less serious of any multiplicious specifications shall be dismissed after findings have been reached. Due consideration must be given, however, to possible post-trial or appellate action with regard to the remaining specification.</p>

<h2>Rule 908. Appeal by the United States</h2>
<section class="level3" id="a-in-general.-27">
<h3>(a) In general.</h3>
<p>In a trial by a court-martial over which a military judge presides and in which a punitive discharge may be adjudged, the United States may appeal an order or ruling that terminates the proceedings with respect to a charge or specification, or excludes evidence that is substantial proof of a fact material in the proceedings, or directs the disclosure of classified information, or that imposes sanctions for nondisclosure of classified information. The United States may also appeal a refusal by the military judge to issue a protective order sought by the United States to prevent the disclosure of classified information or to enforce such an order that has previously been issued by the appropriate authority. However, the United States may not appeal an order or ruling that is, or amounts to, a finding of not guilty with respect to the charge or specification.</p>

<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>A plea of guilty must be in accord with the truth. Before the plea is accepted, the accused must admit every element of the offense(s) to which the accused pleaded guilty. Ordinarily, the elements should be explained to the accused. If any potential defense is raised by the accused's account of the offense or by other matter presented to the military judge, the military judge should explain such a defense to the accused and should not accept the plea unless the accused admits facts which negate the defense. If the statute of limitations would otherwise bar trial for the offense, the military judge should not accept a plea of guilty to it without an affirmative waiver by the accused. _ See_ R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(B). The accused need not describe from personal recollection all the circumstances necessary to establish a factual basis for the plea. Nevertheless the accused must be convinced of, and able to describe all the facts necessary to establish guilt. For example, an accused may be unable to recall certain events in an offense, but may still be able to adequately describe the offense based on witness statements or similar sources which the accused believes to be true. The accused should remain at the counsel table during questioning by the military judge.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>When trial is by a court-martial with members, the court-martial is ordinarily assembled immediately after the members are sworn. The members are ordinarily sworn at the first session at which they appear, as soon as all parties and personnel have been announced. The members are seated with the president, who is the senior member, in the center, and the other members alternately to the president's right and left according to rank. If the rank of a member is changed, or if the membership of the court-martial changes, the members should be reseated accordingly. When trial is by military judge alone, the court-martial is ordinarily assembled immediately following approval of the request for trial by military judge alone. Assembly of the court-martial is significant because it marks the point after which: substitution of the members and military judge may no longer take place without good cause (<em>see</em> Article 29; R.C.M. 505; 902; 912); the accused may no longer, as a matter of right, request trial by military judge alone or withdraw such a request previously approved (<em>see</em> Article 16; R.C.M. 903(a)(2)(d)); and the accused may no longer request, even with the permission of the military judge, or withdraw from a request for, enlisted members (<em>see</em> Article 25(c)(1); R.C.M. 903(a)(1)(d)).</p>

<section class="level4" id="discussion-329">
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>Examination of the members is called "voir dire." If the members have not already been placed under oath for the purpose of voir dire (<em>see</em> R.C.M. 807(b)(2) Discussion (B)), they should be sworn before they are questioned. The opportunity for voir dire should be used to obtain information for the intelligent exercise of challenges; counsel should not purposely use voir dire to present factual matter which will not be admissible or to argue the case. The nature and scope of the examination of members is within the discretion of the military judge. Members may be questioned individually or collectively. Ordinarily, the military judge should permit counsel to personally question the members. Trial counsel ordinarily conducts an inquiry before the defense. Whether trial counsel will question all the members before the defense begins or whether some other procedure will be followed depends on the circumstances. For example, when members are questioned individually outside the presence of other members, each party would ordinarily complete questioning that member before another member is questioned. The military judge and each party may conduct additional questioning, after initial questioning by a party, as necessary. Ordinarily the members should be asked whether they are aware of any ground for challenge against them. This may expedite further questioning. The members should be cautioned, however, not to disclose information in the presence of other members which might disqualify them.</p>

<p>Each witness must testify under oath. <em>See</em> R.C.M. 807(b)(1)(B); Mil. R. Evid. 603. After a witness is sworn, the witness should be identified for the record (full name, rank, and unit, if military, or full name and address, if civilian). The party calling the witness conducts direct examination of the witness, followed by cross-examination of the witness by the opposing party. Redirect and re-cross-examination are conducted as necessary, followed by any questioning by the military judge and members. <em>See</em> Mil. R. Evid. 611; 614. All documentary and real evidence (except marks or wounds on a person's body) should be marked for identification when first referred to in the proceedings and should be included in the record of trial whether admitted in evidence or not. <em> See</em> R.C.M. 1103(b)(2)(C), (c). "Real evidence" include physical objects, such as clothing, weapons, and marks or wounds on a person's body. If it is impracticable to attach an item of real evidence to the record, the item should be clearly and accurately described by testimony, photographs, or other means so that it may be considered on review. Similarly, when documentary evidence is used, if the document cannot be attached to the record (as in the case of an original official record or a large map), a legible copy or accurate extract should be included in the record.

<ol type="A">
<li><p>Apprehended, on reasonable grounds, that death or grievous bodily harm was about to be inflicted wrongfully on the accused; and</p></li>

<section class="level6" id="discussion-351">
<h6>Discussion</h6>
<p>The words "involving deadly force" described the factual circumstances of the case, not specific assault offenses. If the accused is charged with simple assault, battery or any form of aggravated assault, or if simple assault, battery or any form of aggravated assault is in issue as a lesser included offense, the accused may rely on this subsection if the test specified in subsections (A) and (B) is satisfied. The test for the first element of self-defense is objective. Thus, the accused's apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm must have been one which a reasonable, prudent person would have held under the circumstances. Because this test is objective, such matters as intoxication or emotional instability of the accused are irrelevant. On the other hand, such matters as the relative height, weight, and general build of the accused and the alleged victim, and the possibility of safe retreat are ordinarily among the circumstances which should be considered in determining the reasonableness of the apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm. The test for the second element is entirely subjective. The accused is not objectively limited to the use of reasonable force. Accordingly, such matters as the accused's emotional control, education, and intelligence are relevant in determining the accused's actual belief as to the force necessary to repel the attack. <em> See also</em> Mil. R. Evid. 404(a)(2) as to evidence concerning the character of the victim.</p>

<p>The right to self-defense is lost and the defenses described in subsections (e)(1), (2), and (3) of this rule shall not apply if the accused was an aggressor, engaged in mutual combat, or provoked the attack which gave rise to the apprehension, unless the accused had withdrawn in good faith after the aggression, combat, or provocation and before the offense alleged occurred.</p>
<section class="level5" id="discussion-354">
<h5>Discussion</h5>
<p>A person does not become an aggressor or provocateur merely because that person approaches another to seek an interview, even if the approach is not made in a friendly manner. For example, one may approach another and demand an explanation of offensive words or redress of a complaint. If the approach is made in a nonviolent manner, the right to self-defense is not lost. Failure to retreat, when retreat is possible, does not deprive the accused of the right to self-defense if the accused was lawfully present. The availability of avenues of retreat is one factor which may be considered in addressing the reasonableness of the accused's apprehension of bodily harm and the sincerity of the accused's belief that the force used was necessary for self-protection.</p>

<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>The "Government" includes agents of the Government and persons cooperating with them (for example, informants). The fact that persons acting for the Government merely afford opportunities or facilities for the commission of the offense does not constitute entrapment. Entrapment occurs only when the criminal conduct is the product of the creative activity of law enforcement officials.

<section class="level3" id="h-coercion-or-duress.">
<h3>(h) Coercion or duress.</h3>
<p>It is a defense to any offense except killing an innocent person that the accused's participation in the offense was caused by a reasonable apprehension that the accused or another innocent person would be immediately killed or would immediately suffer serious bodily injury if the accused did not commit the act. The apprehension must reasonably continue throughout the commission of the act. If the accused has any reasonable opportunity to avoid committing the act without subjecting the accused or another innocent person to the harm threatened, this defense shall not apply.</p>
<section class="level4" id="discussion-358">
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>The immediacy of the harm necessary may vary with the circumstances.

<section class="level4" id="discussion-359">
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>The test of inability is objective in nature. The accused's opinion that a physical impairment prevented performance of the duty will not suffice unless the opinion is reasonable under all the circumstances. If the physical or financial inability of the accused occurred through the accused's own fault or design, it is not a defense. For example, if the accused, having knowledge of an order to get a haircut, spends money on other nonessential items, the accused's inability to pay for the haircut would not be a defense.</p>

If the ignorance or mistake goes to an element requiring premeditation, specific intent, willfulness, or knowledge of a particular fact, the ignorance or mistake need only have existed in the mind of the accused. If the ignorance or mistake goes to any other element requiring only general intent or knowledge, the ignorance or mistake must have existed in the mind of the accused and must have been reasonable under all the circumstances.

The accused must prove this defense by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>
<section class="level5" id="discussion-360">
<h5>Discussion</h5>
<p>Examples of ignorance or mistake which need only exist in fact include: ignorance of the fact that the person assaulted was an officer; belief that property allegedly stolen belonged to the accused; belief that a controlled substance was really sugar. Examples of ignorance or mistake which must be reasonable as well as actual include: belief that the accused charged with unauthorized absence had permission to go; belief that the accused had a medical "profile" excusing shaving as otherwise required by regulation. Some offenses require special standards of conduct (see, for example, paragraph 68, Part IV, Dishonorable failure to maintain sufficient funds); the element of reasonableness must be applied in accordance with the standards imposed by such offenses. Examples of offenses in which the accused's intent or knowledge is immaterial include: any rape of a child, or any sexual assault or sexual abuse of a child when the child is under 12 years old.

<section class="level5" id="discussion-365">
<h5>Discussion</h5>
<p>For example, ignorance that it is a crime to possess marijuana is not a defense to wrongful possession of marijuana. Ignorance or mistake of law may be a defense in some limited circumstances. If the accused, because of a mistake as to a separate nonpenal law, lacks the criminal intent or state of mind necessary to establish guilt, this may be a defense. For example, if the accused, under mistaken belief that the accused is entitled to take an item under property law, takes an item, this mistake of law (as to the accused's legal right) would, if genuine, be a defense to larceny. On the other hand, if the accused disobeyed an order, under the actual but mistaken belief that the order was unlawful, this would not be a defense because the accused's mistake was as to the order itself, and not as to a separate nonpenal law. Also, mistake of law may be a defense when the mistake results from reliance on the decision or pronouncement of an authorized public official or agency. For example, if an accused, acting on the advice of an official responsible for administering benefits that the accused is entitled to those benefits, applies for and receives those benefits, the accused may have a defense even though the accused was not legally eligible for the benefits.

If the request is for findings on specific matters, the military judge may require that the request be written. Special findings may be entered orally on the record at the court-martial or in writing during or after the court-martial, but in any event shall be made before authentication and included in the record of trial.</p>
<section class="level4" id="discussion-370">
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>Special findings ordinarily include findings as to the elements of the offenses of which the accused has been found guilty, and any affirmative defense relating thereto. <em>See also</em> R.C.M. 905(d); Mil. R. Evid. 304(d)(4); 311(d)(4); 321(f) concerning other findings to be made by the military judge. Members may not make special findings.</p>

<section class="level3" id="c-basis-of-findings.">
<h3>(c) Basis of findings.</h3>
<p>Findings may be based on direct or circumstantial evidence. Only matters properly before the court-martial on the merits of the case may be considered. A finding of guilty of any offense may be reached only when the factfinder is satisfied that guilt has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<section class="level4" id="discussion-371">
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>Direct evidence is evidence which tends directly to prove or disprove a fact in issue (for example, an element of the offense charged). Circumstantial evidence is evidence which tends directly to prove not a fact in issue but some other fact or circumstance from which, either alone or together with other facts or circumstances, one may reasonably infer the existence or nonexistence of a fact in issue. There is no general rule for determining or comparing the weight to be given to direct or circumstantial evidence. A reasonable doubt is a doubt based on reason and common sense. A reasonable doubt is not mere conjecture; it is an honest, conscientious doubt suggested by the evidence, or lack of it, in the case. An absolute or mathematical certainty is not required. The rule as to reasonable doubt extends to every element of the offense. It is not necessary that each particular fact advanced by the prosecution which is not an element be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The factfinder should consider the inherent probability or improbability of the evidence, using common sense and knowledge of human nature, and should weigh the credibility of witnesses. A fact finder may properly believe one witness and disbelieve others whose testimony conflicts with that of the one. A factfinder may believe part of the testimony of a witness and disbelieve other parts. Findings of guilty may not be based solely on the testimony of a witness other than the accused which is self-contradictory, unless the contradiction is adequately explained by the witness. Even if apparently credible and corroborated, the testimony of an accomplice should be considered with great caution.</p>

<section class="level4" id="discussion-372">
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>The military judge may exercise reasonable control over argument. <em>See</em> R.C.M. 801(a)(3).</p>
<p>Argument may include comment about the testimony, conduct, motives, interests, and biases of witnesses to the extent supported by the evidence. Counsel should not express a personnel belief or opinion as to the truth or falsity of any testimony or evidence or the guilt or innocence of the accused, nor should counsel make arguments calculated to inflame passions or prejudices. In argument counsel may treat the testimony of witnesses as conclusively establishing the facts related by the witnesses. Counsel may not cite legal authorities or the facts of other cases when arguing to members on findings. Trial counsel may not comment on the accused's exercise of the right against self-incrimination or the right to counsel. <em>See</em> Mil. R. Evid. 512. Trial counsel may not argue that the prosecution's evidence is unrebutted if the only rebuttal could come from the accused. When the accused is on trial for several offenses and testifies only as to some of the offenses, trial counsel may not comment on the accused's failure to testify as to the others. When the accused testifies on the merits regarding an offense charged, trial counsel may comment on the accused's failure in that testimony to deny or explain specific incriminating facts that the evidence for the prosecution tends to establish regarding that offense. Trial counsel may not comment on the failure of the defense to call witnesses or of the accused to testify at the Article 32 preliminary hearing or upon the probable effect of the court-martial's findings on relations between the military and civilian communities. The rebuttal argument of trial counsel is generally limited to matters argued by the defense. If trial counsel is permitted to introduce new matter in closing argument, the defense should be allowed to reply in rebuttal. However, this will not preclude trial counsel from presenting a final argument.</p>

<h5>Discussion</h5>
<p>A matter is "in issue" when some evidence, without regard to its source or credibility, has been admitted upon which members might rely if they choose. An instruction on a lesser included offense is proper when an element from the charged offense which distinguishes thatoffense from the lesser offense is in dispute. <em>See</em> R.C.M. 918(c) and discussion as to reasonable doubt and other matters relating to the basis for findings which may be the subject of an instruction. Other matters which may be the subject of instruction in appropriate cases included: inferences (<em>see</em> the explanations in Part IV concerning inferences relating to specific offenses); the limited purpose for which evidence was admitted (regardless of whether such evidence was offered by the prosecution of defense) (<em>see</em> Mil. R. Evid. 105); the effect of character evidence (<em>see</em> Mil. R. Evid. 404; 405); the effect of judicial notice (<em>see</em> Mil. R. Evid. 201, 201A); the weight to be given a pretrial statement (<em>see</em> Mil. R. Evid. 340(e)); the effect of stipulations (<em>see</em> R.C.M. 811); that, when a guilty plea to a lesser included offense has been accepted, the members should accept as proved the matters admitted by the plea, but must determine whether the remaining elements are established; that a plea of guilty to one offense may not be the basis for inferring the existence of a fact or element of another offense; the absence of the accused from trial should not be held against the accused; and that no adverse inferences may be drawn from an accused's failure to testify (<em>see</em> Mil. R. Evid. 301(g)). The military judge may summarize and comment upon evidence in the case in instructions. In doing so, the military judge should present an accurate, fair, and dispassionate statement of what the evidence shows; not depart from an impartial role; not assume as true the existence or nonexistence of a fact in issue when the evidence is conflicting or disputed, or when there is no evidence to support the matter; and make clear that the members must exercise their independent judgment as to the facts.</p>

In a civilian case, a "conviction" includes any disposition following an initial judicial determination or assumption of guilt, such as when guilt has been established by guilty plea, trial, or plea of nolo contendere, regardless of the subsequent disposition, sentencing procedure, or final judgment. However, a "civilian conviction" does not include a diversion from the judicial process without a finding or admission of guilt; expunged convictions; juvenile adjudications; minor traffic violations; foreign convictions; tribal court convictions; or convictions reversed, vacated, invalidated or pardoned because of errors of law or because of subsequently discovered evidence exonerating the accused.</p>
<section class="level6" id="discussion-389">
<h6>Discussion</h6>
<p>A vacation of a suspended sentence (<em>see</em> R.C.M. 1109) is not a conviction and is not admissible as such, but may be admissible under subsection (b)(2) of this rule as reflective of the character of the prior service of the accused. Whether a civilian conviction is admissible is left to the discretion of the military judge. As stated in the rule, a civilian "conviction" includes any disposition following an initial judicial determination or assumption of guilt regardless of the sentencing procedure and the final judgment following probation or other sentence. Therefore, convictions may be admissible regardless of whether a court ultimately suspended judgment upon discharge of the accused following probation, permitted withdrawal of the guilty plea, or applies some other form of alternative sentencing. Additionally, the term "conviction" need not be taken to mean a final judgment of conviction and sentence.</p>

<p>A forfeiture deprives the accused of the amount of pay (and allowances) specified as it accrues. Forfeitures accrue to the United States. Forfeitures of pay and allowances adjudged as part of a court-martial sentence, or occurring by operation of Article 58b are effective 14 days after the sentence is adjudged or when the sentence is approved by the convening authority, whichever is earlier. "Basic pay" does not include pay for special qualifications, such as diving pay, or incentive pay such as flying, parachuting, or duty on board a submarine. Forfeiture of pay and allowances under Article 58b is not a part of the sentence, but is an administrative result thereof. At general courts-martial, if both a punitive discharge and confinement are adjudged, then the operation of Article 58b results in total forfeiture of pay and allowances during that period of confinement. If only confinement is adjudged, then if that confinement exceeds six months, the operation of Article 58b results in total forfeiture of pay and allowances during that period of confinement. If only a punitive discharge is adjudged, Article 58b has no effect on pay and allowances. A death sentence results in total forfeiture of pay and allowances. At a special court-martial, if a bad-conduct discharge and confinement are adjudged, then the operation of Article 58b results in a forfeiture of two-thirds of pay only (not allowances) during that period of confinement. If only confinement is adjudged, and that confinement exceeds six months, then the operation of Article 58b results in a forfeiture of two-thirds of pay only (not allowances) during the period of confinement. If only a bad conduct discharge is adjudged, Article 58b has no effect on pay. If the sentence, as approved by the convening authority or other competent authority, does not result in forfeitures by the operation of Article 58b, then only adjudged forfeitures are effective.

In the case of a person serving with or accompanying an armed force in the field, a summary court-martial may not adjudge a fine in excess of two-thirds of one month of the highest rate of enlisted pay, and a special court-martial may not adjudge a fine in excess of two-thirds of one year of the highest rate of officer pay. To enforce collection, a fine may be accompanied by a provision in the sentence that, in the event the fine is not paid, the person fined shall, in addition to any period of confinement adjudged, be further confined until a fixed period considered an equivalent punishment to the fine has expired.

<p>A fine is in the nature of a judgment and, when ordered executed, makes the accused immediately liable to the United States for the entire amount of money specified in the sentence. A fine normally should not be adjudged against a member of the armed forces unless the accused was unjustly enriched as a result of the offense of which convicted. In the case of a civilian subject to military law, a fine, rather than a forfeiture, is the proper monetary penalty to be adjudged, regardless of whether unjust enrichment is present. <em>See</em> R.C.M. 1113(e)(3) concerning imposition of confinement when the accused fails to pay a fine.

<p>Dismissal applies only to commissioned officers, commissioned warrant officers, cadets, and midshipmen and may be adjudged only by a general court-martial.

<h5>(B) Dishonorable discharge.</h5>
<p>A dishonorable discharge applies only to enlisted persons and warrant officers who are not commissioned and may be adjudged only by a general court-martial. Regardless of the maximum punishment specified for an offense in Part IV of this Manual, a dishonorable discharge may be adjudged for any offense of which a warrant officer who is not commissioned has been found guilty. A dishonorable discharge should be reserved for those who should be separated under conditions of dishonor, after having been convicted of offenses usually recognized in civilian jurisdictions as felonies, or of offenses of a military nature requiring severe punishment; and</p>

<p>A bad-conduct discharge applies only to enlisted persons and may be adjudged by a general court-martial and by a special court-martial which has met the requirements of R.C.M. 201(f)(2)(B). A bad-conduct discharge is less severe than a dishonorable discharge and is designed as a punishment for bad-conduct rather than as a punishment for serious offenses of either a civilian or military nature.

<p>Conduct amounts to "reckless indifference" when it evinces a wanton disregard of consequences under circumstances involving grave danger to the life of another, although no harm is necessarily intended. The accused must have had actual knowledge of the grave danger to others or knowledge of circumstances that would cause a reasonable person to realize the highly dangerous character of such conduct. In determining whether participation in the offense was major, the accused's presence at the scene and the extent to which the accused aided, abetted, assisted, encouraged, or advised the other participants should be considered. <em>See United States v.

<li><p>With respect to forfeiture of pay and allowances resulting only by operation of law and not adjudged by the court, the convening authority may waive, for a period not to exceed six months, all or part of the forfeitures for the purpose of providing support to the accused's dependent(s).

<li><p>Factors that may be considered by the convening authority in determining the amount of forfeitures, if any, to be waived include, but are not limited to, the length of the accused's confinement, the number and age(s) of the accused's family members, whether the accused requested waiver, any debts owed by the accused, the ability of the accused's family members to find employment, and the availability of transitional compensation for abused dependents permitted under 10 U.S.C. 1059.</p></li>

<p>Forfeitures resulting by operation of law, rather than those adjudged as part of a sentence, may be waived for six months or for the duration of the period of confinement, whichever is less. The waived forfeitures are paid as support to dependent(s) designated by the convening authority. When directing waiver and payment, the convening authority should identify by name the dependent(s) to whom the payments will be made and state the number of months for which the waiver and payment shall apply. In cases where the amount to be waived and paid is less than the jurisdictional limit of the court, the monthly dollar amount of the waiver and payment should be stated.</p>

<p>Because the action at a proceeding in revision is corrective, a proceeding in revision may not be conducted for the purpose of presenting additional evidence. Examples when a proceeding in revision is appropriate include: correction of an ambiguous or apparently illegal action by the court-martial; inquiry into the terms of a pretrial agreement; and inquiry to establish the accused's awareness of certain rights. <em> See also</em> R.C.M. 1104(d) concerning correction of the record by certificate of correction.</p>

<p>A sentence adjudged by a court-martial may be approved if it was within the jurisdiction of the court-martial to adjudge (<em>see</em> R.C.M.201(f)) and did not exceed the maximum limits prescribed in Part IV and Chapter X of this Part for the offense(s) of which the accused legally has been found guilty. When mitigating forfeitures, the duration and amounts of forfeiture may be changed as long as the total amount forfeited is not increased and neither the amount nor duration of the forfeitures exceeds the jurisdiction of the court-martial. When mitigating confinement or hard labor without confinement, the convening authority should use the equivalencies at R.C.M. 1003(b)(5)-(6), as appropriate. Unless prohibited by this rule, the convening authority may disapprove, mitigate or change to a less severe punishment any individual component of a sentence. For example, if an accused is found guilty of assault consummated by a battery and sentenced to a bad-conduct discharge, three months of confinement, and reduction to E-1, without a pre-trial agreement and without being able to apply the substantial assistance exception, the convening authority may disapprove or reduce any part of the sentence except the bad-conduct discharge.</p>

<p>In determining what sentence should be approved, the convening authority should consider all relevant and permissible factors including the possibility of rehabilitation, the deterrent effect of the sentence, and all matters relating to clemency, such as pretrial confinement. <em>See also</em> R.C.M. 1001- 1004. When an accused is not serving confinement, the accused should not be deprived of more than two-thirds pay for any month as a result of one or more sentences by court-martial and other stoppages or involuntary deductions, unless requested by the accused. Since court-martial forfeitures constitute a loss of entitlement of the pay concerned, they take precedence over all debts.</p>

A Court of Criminal Appeals has generally the same powers as the convening authority to modify a sentence (<em>see </em> R.C.M. 1107), but it may not suspend all or part of a sentence. However, it may reduce the period of a suspension prescribed by a convening authority. It may not defer service of a sentence to confinement. (<em> see</em> R.C.M. 1101(c)). It may, however, review a decision by a convening authority concerning deferral, to determine whether that decision was an abuse of the convening authority's discretion. In considering the record of a case referred to it under R.C.M. 1201, a Court of Criminal Appeals may weigh the evidence, judge the credibility of witnesses, and determine controverted questions of fact, recognizing that the court-martial saw and heard the evidence. A finding or sentence of a court-martial may not be held incorrect on the ground of an error of law unless the error materially prejudices the substantial rights of the accused. Article 59(a). If a Court of Criminal Appeals sets aside any findings of guilty or the sentence, it may, except as to findings set aside for lack of sufficient evidence in the record to support the findings, order an appropriate type of rehearing or reassess the sentence as appropriate. <em>See</em> R.C.M. 810 concerning rehearings. If the Court of Criminal Appeals sets aside all the findings and the sentence and does not order a rehearing, it must order the charges dismissed. _ See_ Articles 59(a) and 66. A Court of Criminal Appeals may on petition for extraordinary relief issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of its jurisdiction and agreeable to the usages and principles of law. Any party may petition a Court of Criminal Appeals for extraordinary relief.</p>

In the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary, the accused is presumed to have the capacity to understand and to conduct or cooperate intelligently in the appellate proceedings.

If the accused does not have the requisite mental capacity, the appellate authority shall stay the proceedings until the accused regains appropriate capacity, or take other appropriate action.

<h2>Rule 1301. Summary courts-martial generally</h2>
<section class="level3" id="a-composition.">
<h3>(a) Composition.</h3>
<p>A summary court-martial is composed of one commissioned officer on active duty. Unless otherwise prescribed by the Secretary concerned a summary court-martial shall be of the same armed force as the accused. Summary courts-martial shall be conducted in accordance with the regulations of the military service to which the accused belongs. Whenever practicable, a summary court-martial should be an officer whose grade is not below lieutenant of the Navy or Coast Guard or captain of the Army, Air Force, or Marine Corps. When only one commissioned officer is present with a command or detachment, that officer shall be the summary court-martial of that command or detachment. When more than one commissioned officer is present with a command or detachment, the convening authority may not be the summary court-martial of that command or detachment.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="b-function.">
<h3>(b) Function.</h3>
<p>The function of the summary court-martial is to promptly adjudicate minor offenses under a simple procedure. The summary court-martial shall thoroughly and impartially inquire into both sides of the matter and shall ensure that the interests of both the Government and the accused are safeguarded and that justice is done. A summary court-martial may seek advice from a judge advocate or legal officer on questions of law, but the summary court-martial may not seek advice from any person on factual conclusions which should be drawn from evidence or the sentence which should be imposed, as the summary court-martial has the independent duty to make these determinations.</p>
